</ol>
<h1>What is serverless?</h1>
<p>As it is with any new innovation, there is no versatile definition that works for everybody. In the case of serverless, it’s even more real because the concept has developed in a relatively short time. And still, lots of people confuse it with other concepts. Here’s the broad, yet the simple definition of “serverless” we think fits it the best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Serverless is a paradigm of executing applications in cloud-native environments that influences the way applications are built and deployed and makes use of cloud-computing advantages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon Wardley, a “serverless” advocate, <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1073379461473730560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defines</a> it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Serverless is] an event-driven, utility-based, stateless, code execution environment in which you write code and consume services.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>A couple of words on What Serverless is NOT:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s not a container. </b>“A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example, differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure,” — shares <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker.com;</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s not a PaaS.</b> Unlike serverless, PaaS refers to a system where there is more (compared to serverless) control over deployment environment; applications take a while to spin up; applications need to be configured to scale automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18782" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676.jpeg" alt="girl works with panoramic view" width="2247" height="1500" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676.jpeg 2247w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-2048x1367.jpeg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-600x401.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1000x668.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2247px) 100vw, 2247px" /></p>
<p>In many sources, you can also find that serverless architecture also means <b>“managed services that scale to zero.”</b> That’s why the scale-to-zero approach or pay for the consumption of computing resources (instead of allocation) is a key concept of the serverless. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>Scaling to zero as the main concept</h2>
<p>&#8220;Scale to zero&#8221; stops consuming resources when there are no requests. Therefore, computation resources become consumed when in use. Serverless cloud providers automatically scale out the application to handle the increased load.</p>
<p>It reduces the overall costs because <b>customers are only billed for the time that the application is running.</b> It’s also known as pay-per-use (pay for consumption and not for allocation). That’s why scale-to-zero is appropriately seen as the main concept of serverless computing.</p>
<h2>Functions as code</h2>
<p>Serverless is frequently used in conjunction with a <b>function-as-a-service (FaaS)</b> offering. In this case, the code is written as a function. In turn, the function acts as a small single-purpose piece of code that runs dynamically in response to some event trigger or on schedule.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that FaaS allows developers to run backend code without managing their server systems, here are some more essential aspects of it:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to language and environment, FaaS functions are regular applications, but have a range of architectural restrictions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Using FaaS with serverless computing requires a different approach to deployment as compared to when you manage your servers. Developers upload code in a FaaS environment to the FaaS vendor who then takes over everything related to deployment. Developers don’t have to do anything;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A FaaS vendor covers all the scaling needs. Developers write a function to assume horizontal-scaled parallelism, and the FaaS vendor covers everything scaling-related from that point. Horizontal scaling is fully automated and elastic;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The FaaS provider fully manages resource provisioning and allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started with FaaS, developers simply bring their function code and wire up event triggers. This is where an event-driven architecture steps in.</p>
<h2>Events as triggers</h2>
<p>The <b>event-driven architecture (or simply EDA)</b> is a software architecture paradigm where code runs in response to events. An event means any change of state in the system, for example, a new message in a queue, the changed record in a DB, a file upload, etc.</p>
<p>Simply put, EDA promotes production, consumption, and reaction to any events. In turn, events trigger business functions or code. For example, when a consumer books a hotel room, the room&#8217;s state changes from &#8220;free&#8221; to &#8220;booked&#8221;. A hotel booking system architecture may treat this state change as an event whose occurrence can be made known to other applications within the architecture.</p>
<h2>Services are all managed</h2>
<p>In a serverless architecture, developers don’t worry about supporting any related services. Such services can include databases, storage, message queues, stream processing, caches, etc.</p>
<p>In turn, developers can connect <b>managed services</b> together, so they shouldn’t think about provisioning, maintaining, and administering these servers and systems. Also, there is no need to ensure application fault tolerance and availability. Cloud providers handle these aspects for them.</p>
<h1>What are the benefits of serverless?</h1>
<p>Before considering the serverless approach for your business, let’s take a closer look at the advantages it has.</p>
<h3><b>1 — Lower Operational Costs</b></h3>
<p>With a Serverless architecture, you pay the vendor only for resources your application consumed, meaning you do not need to allocate costs for managing your own servers, databases, and application logic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18784" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1.jpg" alt="girls work hard to get tasks done" width="2250" height="1500" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1.jpg 2250w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /></p>
<p>While you get the same cost reduction benefits from PaaS (platform as a service) and IaaS (infrastructure as a service), the two do not allow you to pay only for the resources you consume, making Serverless a cheaper option.</p>
<h4>Automated &amp; More Cost-Efficient Scaling</h4>
<p>Serverless comes with automatic and elastic horizontal scaling that is fully managed by the vendor. In many cases, this allows you to cut budget costs in a big way.</p>
<h4>More Optimization — Fewer Expenses</h4>
<p>With a Serverless architecture, there is a direct link between code optimization and operational costs. The more you optimize your application’s code, the less you pay.</p>
<p>Say, your app needs a second to process an event; if you reduce the time to 500 ms, you may instantly save 50% percent from what you paid for minute-long processing. The amount you save may change from vendor to vendor, but the overall picture remains the same — you can save a lot).</p>
<h3><b>2 — Simplified Operational Management</b></h3>
<p>Before starting with this section, it is essential to go back to the fact that Serverless has not matured yet, and different operational nuances will arise as you start using it. Still, that does not dismiss the significant benefits of Serverless architecture in operational management. Let’s see what they are.</p>
<h4>Next-to-no System Administration</h4>
<p>In short, an utterly serverless solution needs zero system administration. The process of packaging and deploying a FaaS function is simple compared to deploying a server — you only need to package your code into a zip file and upload it to the vendor. That’s it. More so, if you are only starting with your application, you can skip the packaging stage and write the code right to the provider’s console.</p>
<h4>More Agility</h4>
<p>The nature of Serverless allows your team to decrease time to market in a reasonable fashion. Plus, with a faster deployment time, teams can experiment with new features and see if the work quickly at a very low cost and with little friction. This, in turn, lowers the lead time and may result in a better final product.</p>

<h3><b>3 — </b><b>Faster time to market</b></h3>
<p>Speed is a new big. Every one aims to get their applications to market as soon as possible. With serverless, it’s quicker and easier: no need to worry about wiring up custom components, the code is shipped many times faster, and there’s less to build from scratch. As a result, developers run deployments with less fuss.</p>
<h3><b>4 — Less Impact on Environment</b></h3>
<p>The world has seen a big spike in the number of data centers in the last Three years, which increased the amount of burnt fossil fuel significantly. Tech giants are considering building centers near renewable energy sources. Still, this will not be enough to reduce the impact due to another issue: highly inefficient capacity management.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, standard servers in organizations deliver <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/06/03/30-of-servers-are-sitting-comatose-according-to-research/#491cd25d59c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no more than 5 to 15 percent</a> of their maximum computing output on average in a year. Serverless computing, on the other hand, frees companies from the challenging task of provisioning computing, capacity all the while allowing serverless vendors to allow just the right amount of resources for their clients, and only when they need them. So, serverless may be the one and the only solution to optimize data center resources worldwide, lowering their environmental impact dramatically.</p>
<h1>What to keep in mind if you&#8217;re considering serverless?</h1>
<p>Serverless has not matured yet, and this way of building and deploying applications has its advantages just as it has some drawbacks. There is an array of issues you need to know about before switching to this paradigm. We will take a closer look at the inherent flaws of the concept, the ones that will never be fixed entirely.</p>
<h3><b>Lack of Control</b></h3>
<p>Using Serverless means your vendor is in control of the parts of your system. This may lead to a wide variety of issues, including <b>functionality loss, forced API upgrades, system downtime</b>, and other issues that may affect your application and its users.</p>
<h3><b>Security </b></h3>
<p>Every newly emerged concept always has a list of security issues, and that’s also the case with serverless. From insecure serverless deployment configuration to inadequate monitoring and logging of functions and insecure third-party dependencies, these are some of the security issues to pay attention to before jumping in a serverless world.</p>
<h3><b>BaaS-Only Serverless Architecture Issues</b></h3>
<p>Serverless may decrease your operational resources, but not entirely. In the case of a 100% BaaS-based architecture,<b> all the logic will be in the client.</b> Backend-as-a-Service (or BaaS) is a cloud service model in which developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend.</p>
<p>So, for your next platforms, you will need to repeat the implementation of a subset of that logic. If you need to migrate to a new database, this will require code replication or coordination change for all of your clients. Another issue with a full BaaS architecture is that you cannot optimize your server design for client performance in no way.</p>
<p>On the bright side, if your serverless architecture uses only FaaS, these issues are non-existent.</p>
<h3><b>Technology Limitations</b></h3>
<p>Not all technologies can be used due to the scale-to-zero concept. The so-called slow <b>“cold start”</b> (first execution after scaling to zero) can lead to performance issues. Some applications require more time to start and then work fast. And for serverless fast startup time is always crucial.</p>
<h3><b>Doesn’t Suite Some Tasks</b></h3>
<p>There are some tasks where serverless is <b>worse fit than traditional models.</b> For such tasks, the usage of serverless may lead to increasing costs.</p>
<h3><b>FaaS-Only Serverless Architecture Issues</b></h3>
<p>FaaS functions have major <b>local state restrictions</b>, meaning you should not take it as given that the state from one invocation of a FaaS function will be available to another invocation of the same function.</p>
<p>If you cannot store states in memory, using a fast NoSQL database may do the trick alongside a number of other options, but all of them are significantly slower than in-memory or on-machine persistence, and the latter will not fit each and every project.</p>
<h1>The Future is Serverless</h1>
<p>It’s hard to predict where serverless computing will be a year from now. Looking back at the current state of serverless, its evolution over the last several years, how vendors address existing issues, as well as the growing community, we can expect the following developments in years to come.</p>
<p><b>Better Tooling</b>. There’s no road ahead for serverless if the existing tooling stops evolving. Luckily, Amazon and other vendors have been improving things like deployment/application bundling and configuration, and we can expect vendors in general to make improvements in other important areas, such as remote debugging and distributed monitoring.</p>
<p><b>Serverless FaaS Will Fit More Applications</b>. Serverless FaaS doesn’t have a consistent in-server state, so such an architecture will not be able to support high-throughput applications.</p>
<p>While vendors will surely try to make function instances active between events for a longer time, the hybrid approach — an architecture combining serverless and non-serverless execution models — is likely to be the better option for such applications.</p>
<p><b>Fewer implementation Issues. </b>From deployment to packaging to integration testing to the opaqueness of monitoring support, there is a very long list of issues when it comes to implementing serverless applications as of today. As vendors are gradually fixing implementation-related issues, we can expect them to deal with all the problems existing in this area today as well.</p>
<p><b>Emergence of First Solid Serverless Practices</b>. Although a lot is clear about nature serverless computing and how it can benefit teams and applications they design, it is still a very, very young field will little-to-no guidelines for the long-term as well as many blank spaces across the board.</p>
<p>So, in the next several years, we can expect the serverless rule book to start shaping up. It will outline where serverless fits best and where traditional ways are more favorable, the best ways to implement serverless, how to build a hybrid serverless architecture, and so on. The answers will come from both sides — the vendors, and the community.</p>
<p>That doesn’t end here, but vendors will surely try to tackle these first. Will serverless become the new normal for application architectures? It has the potential, but, as with many things, only time will tell.</p>
<h1>Should your business switch to serverless now?</h1>
<p>In 2017 the serverless market was worth around $3 billion. By 2025, it’s predicted to go up to $20 billion. Many giants are already adopting serverless. To name a few, Netflix, Coca Cola, Airbnb, EA, Vevo, MongoDB, Accenture, etc.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18787" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics.jpg" alt="graph for serverless stats in the usa" width="1170" height="740" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics.jpg 1170w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-768x486.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-600x379.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-450x285.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-1000x632.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" />If you consider switching to serverless, we suggest keeping in mind two things:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You should not migrate all your apps to serverless right away. Try and test first;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Serverless is the right direction for the future for two main reasons: it gives the opportunity to deliver value to customers quickly and lets you pay only for the used resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, there are still numerous pitfalls and execution bottlenecks utilizing serverless. Moreover, security is one of the top issues that should be resolved over time. Yet one thing the entire market knows is that serverless is inevitable, and it will own the market. It’s all just a matter of time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 23, Devmind’s top experts of the Construction Industry went live for a 40-minute webinar to discuss how construction leaders should act now to think one step ahead of the current crisis.</p>
<p>Our experts weigh in on the latest research and trends to help to imagine the perfect digitization phases for one building development and more effective, affordable, and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>The “Digital Transformation in Construction. Thinking One Step Ahead” tackled the areas of implementation, real-life examples, constraints, and more regarding the potential digital transformation steps as different layers or dimensions of the BIM repository and other essential tools.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Watch The Video:</b></a></h2>

<h2>Digitalization as XD Roadmap</h2>
<p>Digital transformation in the construction industry is not just a nice to have thing from a design, estimating, and safety perspective. It is also becoming a part of state regulations in most developed countries.</p>
<p>During the webinar, we considered the adoption of 3D and CAD modeling as the base-level and reviewed all other D’s to 8D as a new layer or dimension added new Interactions between parties, collaboration opportunities, and other benefits.</p>
<p>Talking about the ecosystem, there were five parties of system interactions: customers who would be a project owner, a cost control department, management including Project and Operations managers, third-party vendors and contractors, and engineers and developers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19912" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg" alt="webinar roadmap " width="1563" height="1177" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg 1563w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-768x578.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-600x452.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-450x339.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1000x753.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1563px) 100vw, 1563px" /></p>
<p>In the 3D case, our base level, we assumed that all designing and engineering work is done in 3D. So all initial project documentation right from the start is digital. We have Architects and Engineers collaborating and sharing on the system. The 4th dimension or 4D case would be time.</p>
<p>In the particular version the BIM repository adds:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Planning and Estimation;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration with construction management tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Documents, Materials, and Phases approvals workflows;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Deep integration with Design and construction simulation tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the 5th dimension, we would add costs. In the 6th layer, we add even more parties and control to the system. The 7th dimension is all about post-production management, operations, and reconstruction. And finally, the last 8th dimension is safety during the project and after it is completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch Webinar</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 quarantine got us like we are all watching another ‘Black Mirror’ episode. Though it is the reality, we’re living in, and many of us start learning how to get the best of it.</p>

<p>So get yourself comfortable, as we’re about to dive into the best platforms to expand your skills and knowledge in 2020.</p>
<h2><b>What is an online</b><b> learning platform?</b></h2>
<p>Generally, an E-learning platform <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-is-an-online-learning-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a portal or a learning environment that enables a person to get educational content or/and online instructions on a particular topic</a>. The format of the content can vary presentations, video lectures, webinars, quizzes, articles, and even educational jokes. What is more, depending on a platform, you can get access for free with/without registration, or you will need to pay for membership/or courses. In other words, an online learning platform is a space with endless opportunities to acquire comprehensive knowledge via easy-to-use and engaging tools.</p>
<h2><b>What are the</b><b> best online learning platforms?</b></h2>
<p>In the list below, we have reviewed and picked the best e-learning portals in 2020.

<h3><b>Top Online Learning Platforms: </b><b>Final Words</b></h3>
<p>No doubt, E-learning is paving its way to shape the way we see education and is no longer perceived as something trivial. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/31/e-learning-climbing-to-325-billion-by-2025-uf-canvas-absorb-schoology-moodle/#133485633b39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">By 2025 E-learning is predicted to reach revenue of $325 billion.</a> The demand for engaging and interactive learning is rising, and these days learning platforms online can rise again sharply, leaving traditional institutions behind.</p>
<p>Among the main reasons why online learning continues gaining its popularity are affordability, interactivity, and relevance. Generally, massive institutions are falling behind, being unable to adjust the curriculum and the scope of knowledge fast. Nowadays, the demand for particular skills can change overnight, and online platforms can tailor the courses way quicker to meet the needs of learners. Not to mention, the new challenge of being isolated and having to study from home during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Summing up, quarantine exposed people to many problems, and education has become one of them. However, thanks to endless opportunities open online, not only can we tackle the challenge, but we can also reap all the benefits of having flexible schedules and acquiring relevant knowledge.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How many top-rated TV apps do you really know?</h2>
<p>Indeed, how many? The majority knows Netflix and YouTube. Some others will recall Amazon and Disney, probably. But only a couple of people realize there are at least 15 excellent TV apps you can enjoy this season.</p>
<p>When you stay home and have plenty of free time because of COVID-19, the most obvious lifestyle is to lay on a couch, watch movies or TV series, and wait until this disaster is over. You are likely to get bored with this pretty fast.</p>
<p>And if this quarantine has shown any clear thing about Netflix, it is that this streaming service is not perfect. YouTube is also an unreliable partner — especially after the news that the streaming quality of this service is lower than usual now.</p>

<h2>The leader of top Apple TV apps</h2>
<h3 id="netflix">#1 Netflix</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19836 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11.png" alt="Netflix TV apps" width="1310" height="681" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11.png 1310w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-300x156.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-1024x532.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-768x399.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-600x312.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-450x234.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-1000x520.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" /></p>
<p>Netflix is the leader in the streaming industry. It rocks not only the rating of TV apps but also the list of top apps for Apple TV (leaving far behind Apple TV Plus, for example). If you want to enjoy high-quality video content, subscribe to Netflix.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Up to 6 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $8.99 per month (Basic), $12.99 per month (Standard), $15.99 per month (Premium)</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list: </b></p>
<p>+ Supports all the top platforms</p>
<p>+ The breathtaking collection of Netflix originals</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Paid subscription only</li>
</ul>
<p>According to TCL, the leading streamer in the USA, Netflix is the most used TV app in the country (not a surprise). Of course, Netflix is cool, and you don’t need this guide to learn its value. At the same time, there’s still some room for improvement.</p>
<p>Netflix has premium status in the world of TV apps, so you must pass the procedure of signing in and paying to watch the videos. Not everybody likes it.</p>
<p>Netflix library cannot cover all the videos you might be interested in. Even though it offers over 100,000 hours of watching, some content types are absent from Netflix. So, the fans of live sports, classic movies, and news have already found better alternatives. The same applies to people interested in free streaming.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Netflix originals cover all the possible flaws of this platform. Subscribe to enjoy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/netflix/id363590051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download from AppStore.</a></p>
<h3 id="youtube">#2 YouTube TV</h3>

<p>Everyone loves YouTube, and its YouTube TV experience is highly enjoyable. The service works cable-free, works on numerous devices, and has a huge library of broadcasts available.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams: </b>Up to 3 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $12 per month</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Compatible with numerous devices</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">High subscription price</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube is another obvious choice for top TV apps. Containing all sorts of videos, YouTube TV service offers to download and watch them later offline.</p>
<p>The streaming on YouTube TV is free of advertisement after you pay for the subscription.</p>
<p>As a choice for Fire TV, YouTube TV enables browsing by interest area, connecting your device with several accounts, searching by voice, and playing 4K video.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-tv/id1193350206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download from AppStore.</a></p>
<h3 id="amazon">#3 Amazon Prime Video</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19827 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2.png" alt="Amazon TV apps" width="1289" height="657" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2.png 1289w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-300x153.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-768x391.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-600x306.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-450x229.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-1000x510.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1289px) 100vw, 1289px" /></p>
<p>Amazon Prime Video is also a leader in the TV streaming market. The application is a real competitor to Netflix and a second choice for most movie admirers.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $12 per month / $119 per year</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<p>+ Supports all the top platforms</p>
<p>+ Offers unique content (Amazon originals)</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Paid subscription only</li>
</ul>
<p>According to TCL, Amazon Prime Video is the #3 choice for the U.S. citizens aged 35-54. Generally, the TV app is popular all over the world. In its library, you can find different types of content: movies, TV shows, documentaries, Amazon originals, and live TV streams.</p>
<p>It seems like a nice alternative to Netflix originals if you want to try something different.</p>

<h3 id="hulu">#4 Hulu</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19833 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8.png" alt="Hulu TV apps" width="1408" height="683" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8.png 1408w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-300x146.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-1024x497.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-768x373.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-600x291.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-450x218.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-1000x485.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" /></p>
<p>Hulu is an app where you can watch thousands of TV shows and movies. Also, the content types include sports and news upon subscription.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> 2 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $5.99 per month</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A limited collection of movies</li>
</ul>
<p>Hulu library contains plenty of movies, TV, news, and funny videos. To navigate it easier, the developers added the “Favorite” option and interest-based search.</p>
<p>In addition, you can access hundreds of TV channels through this app. For your convenience, all of them are ranged by genre — be that regional news or comedy shows day-and-night. The great thing to mention about Hulu TV is the absence of annoying advertising between your favorite shows.</p>
<p>All these characteristics make it reasonable to state that Hulu is a television app of the new generation.</p>

<h3 id="disney">#5 Disney Plus</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19832 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7.png" alt="Disnep TV apps" width="1337" height="690" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7.png 1337w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7-300x155.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7-1024x528.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7-768x396.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7-600x310.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7-450x232.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image7-1000x516.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1337px) 100vw, 1337px" /></p>
<p>The library of Disney Plus consists of 5 content hubs: Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, and National Geographic. If you want to be the first in catching the trends like Baby Yoda, this TV app is for you!</p>
<p>In the family of Disney TV products, you can also install Disney Channel!, Disney Junior!, and Disney XD.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Google Chromecast, iOS, Xbox One, Android, Apple TV, PS4, Amazon, and Android TV</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Up to 4 devices in 4K resolution free</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $6.99 per month/ $69.99 per year (USA); $8.99 per month/ $89.99 per year (Canada and Australia); €6.99 per month / €69.99 per year (EU countries)</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Offers 7 days of a free trial</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Contains the complete library of Disney movies (old and fresh)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Supports only Roku (no Samsung or LG TV compatibility)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A limited collection of movies</li>
</ul>
<p>The TV application Disney created arranges in one place the House of Mouse, Star Wars, Pixar, and Marvel planets. But the most important, of course, is the guaranteed access to all the beloved good-old Disney movies. Only this fact is worth paying all the money asked for the subscription!</p>
<p>But of course, if you are a TV app user whose interests expand further than Disney movie library, this offering is too limited for you.</p>
<p>Disney Plus provides its subscribers a unique opportunity to watch new Disney content without the need to attend traditional cinema premier day. For the Coronavirus lockdown, this fact is a truly needed know-how.</p>

Both apps offer each piece of content available on HBO. So, if you’re a fan of this platform, the offering is designed especially for you.</p>
<p>For the next month, HBO is preparing HBO Max — the TV app that will become an umbrella software for the HBO content products. So, going for HBO next month will be a really good investment in your future joy and fun.</p>

<h3>The best choice among top Android TV apps</h3>
<h3 id="sling">#7 Sling TV</h3>

</ul>
<ul>

<h2>The best picks among top Fire TV apps</h2>
<h3 id="plex">#12 Plex</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19837 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12.png" alt="Plex TV apps" width="1367" height="694" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12.png 1367w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-300x152.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-1024x520.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-768x390.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-600x305.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-450x228.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-1000x508.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1367px) 100vw, 1367px" /></p>
<p>Plex is among the top apps for Fire TV, fitting the functionality of this platform perfectly. Its library is really huge and features Bollywood movies, rare documentaries, and musicals.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> Android, iOS, Roku, LG Smart TV, Amazon Alexa, Sony Smart TV, Toshiba Smart TV, PlayStation 4, Vizio, Xbox One</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Up to 3 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $4.99 per month / $39.99 per year</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Great UX</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Huge compatibility list</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Not that many streams among them can work simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p>MakeUseOf magazine lists Plex as a top remote app for TV streaming on Fire TV. We couldn’t omit this app from our overview as well.</p>
<p>Plex is a great choice for streaming movies from your library on different devices around your house. If you decide to go for Plex Pass, you won’t need an Internet connection to play those videos.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Plex is that you can download it from Amazon Appstore. As an Android TV app, the installation process requires a Plex server. It should be on another laptop that connects to your Android device through Wi-Fi. After that, Plex will play your files instantly, without using wires for transferring files.</p>
<p>Finally, this TV app works as a media center application that is really enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>By the way, to make your Fire TV works correctly, make sure</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your ADB Debugging is enabled (Select “My Fire TV” is Settings and put ADB Debugging “On” in the Developer Options menu)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Stick allows the installation of unknowing services (Choose “Device” and “Developer Options” in Settings, you’ll see “Apps from Unknown Services” in the menu)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="kodi">#13 Kodi</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19826 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1.png" alt="Kodi TV apps" width="1707" height="714" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1.png 1707w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1-300x125.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1-1024x428.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1-768x321.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1-1536x642.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1-600x251.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1-450x188.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image1-1000x418.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p>Another great choice for Fire TV. The app works as an entire entertainment hub compatible with all the basic devices to enjoy watching video streams.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> Windows PC, Mac, Linux Raspberry Pi, Android 5.0</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $35 per year</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It’s more than just a TV app</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Completely free of advertisement</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Not available in AppStore</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Not perfect UX</li>
</ul>
<p>Among all, Kodi is a media server application. In other words, you can accumulate all types of media content in one place. And if you choose to install some add-ons offered, you can empower your Kodi TV app even more.</p>
<p>As an Android TV app, Kodi helps arrange your media library with an easy-to-follow hierarchy. In particular, it will prescribe categories to your offline files and help with placing them in proper locations. The type of content Kodi works with includes movies, documentaries, music, live TV clips, etc.</p>
<p>To work on Fire TV, it requires sideloading onto another device. That’s why it’s not recommended for people who don’t like working with settings. To install, read a couple of articles in Google on the matter — there’s nothing difficult about learning how to do it, learning how to do it just requires extra time.</p>
<p>Kodi is not compatible with iOS, but you can download several options for remote control from AppStore.</p>

<p>Pandora is a free radio streaming service compatible with numerous devices. In addition to songs, there are some comedy channels for entertainment.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen,LG Smart TV</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Limitless</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> Free</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Free service</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The library has only comedies</li>
</ul>
<p>This year, Pandora has become one of the top 3 picks for the U.S. millennials. And there’s no surprise — the app outperforms Spotify for being free. The functionality of the app allows playing favorite shows on TV, in web browsers, or on the screen of your car.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the video library of the app has only comedy channels. That’s why it deserved a place at the bottom of our list only, no matter how user-friendly the experience offered is. But you can try its comedies — maybe, you’ll like them.</p>

<h3 id="google">#15 Google Play Movies &amp; TV</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19840 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15.png" alt="Google TV apps" width="1344" height="688" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15.png 1344w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15-300x154.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15-1024x524.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15-768x393.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15-600x307.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15-450x230.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image15-1000x512.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px" /></p>
<p>The platform is a digital storefront of movies and TV shows. Users are offered to either purchase a digital license or rent a chosen file for several days. There is no subscription option.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b>  TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Limitless</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> In-app purchases in à la carte menu of movies</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Supports all top TV platforms</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A very limited choice and number of functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Play Movies &amp; TV resembles an old-fashioned shop where you could rent some movies and bring them back. Though sounding rather romantic, this approach is a bit outdated in the contemporary world. It’s much easier (and cheaper) to buy for the service, not for each movie separately.</p>
<p>But the experience is worth a try.</p>
<p>The very idea of Google Play Movies &amp; TV appeared in the competition with iTunes from Apple. In the latest version, the developers added such a heavy compatibility package that the app turned into a complete TV streaming service. However, the software requires lots of other features to become a top pick in the niche.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The business impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on industries across the world is now profound. Leaders and CIOs should rev up their digital business strategies and position themselves for growth when the pandemic subsides. How exactly should leaders manage this impact and get the most out of opportunities? Here’s our answer.</p>

<p>Today, for the global sectors, COVID-19 presents two challenges: largely idled sectors disrupting trade and reduced demand from consumers. A few examples to consider, Chile is reeling from reduced copper demand. Germany — from auto parts shortage.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine how different industries react to business and economic turbulence caused by the novel pandemic through innovation and digital capabilities. We discover this through <b>the example of 8 industries that try to win over the battle using digital and innovation capabilities.</b></p>
<h2 id="healthcare"><b>Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>As each industry emerges from its acute response phase, many will find that they are entering a “new normal.” Expect the way healthcare is practiced and marketed to be no different.</p>
<p>Beyond the negative impact of a traditional economic downturn, COVID-19 presents additional challenges — fear from the virus itself, collective grief, prolonged physical distancing, and associated social isolation — that will compound the impact on our collective <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/helping-us-healthcare-stakeholders-understand-the-human-side-of-the-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19717" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg" alt="stress Covid" width="1200" height="699" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1024x596.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-768x447.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-600x350.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-450x262.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1000x583.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Reported signs of distress related to COVID-19 in the US.</i></p>
<p>As the way healthcare is practiced evolves, so too will the environment and platforms through which that care is delivered. There will be new needs that emerge; new content will be needed, in new formats, manifesting in new marketing assets.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Healthcare and Other Solutions</h3>
<p>There are three areas that healthcare marketing leaders should focus on, as the impact on their business and the subsequent need to adapt will be significant:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Telehealth</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/telehealth-53-growing-faster-any-other-place-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acceptance and utilization of telehealth</a> services within the US were already on a sharp incline before the COVID-19 crisis erupted countrywide.  Since then, medical and municipal leaders are leveraging the platform as a tool in combating the spread of COVID-19, accelerating adoption in the process.</p>
<p>From a Payer perspective, CVS Health, Aetna, Cigna, and United Health are just a few of the payer organizations recommending patients move to virtual care – going so far as to waive copays for utilizing the service.</p>
<p>Consumers are showing increased interest as well, with <a href="https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/disaster-zone/what-are-people-searching-for-on-the-web--relating-to-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEMRush reporting</a> a 146.15% increase in searches for “in-home doctor visits” and a 53.97% increase in “in-home medical care” searches.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Urgent care</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Urgent Care Centers are quickly becoming the front door in a person’s treatment journey.  A study from the Urgent Care Association found that a median of<a href="https://www.ucaoa.org/About-UCA/Industry-News/ArtMID/10309/ArticleID/877/Booming-Urgent-Care-Industry-Filling-the-Gaps-in-Patient-Care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 35% of patients utilizing UCCs</a> do not have primary care physicians, reflecting the fact that Healthcare is shifting to much more of an on-demand service. Medicare and Medicaid patients made up almost 27% of UCC patients in 2018, confirming that the shift is not driven only by the young or affluent.</p>
<p>The organization is flanking the physical services with digital efforts, with  <a href="https://cvshealth.com/thought-leadership/cvs-health-names-more-us-cities-for-healthhub-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost 30% of the landing pages</a> on CVS.com Minute Clinic specific. Not to be outdone, Walmart<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/business/walmart-health-care-clinics-amazon-cvs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> launched the first of its augmented health facilities</a> in September 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Almost everything goes online</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Medical conferences and congresses are a huge priority for companies in the Health sector. These events are valued by commercial organizations, advocacy groups, and healthcare professionals as key opportunities for medical education, peer-to-peer engagement, and the release of official study data.</p>
<p>While some of those activities have been digitally distributed in parallel, a vast majority of that activity is face-to-face. The COVID-19 crisis is forcing digital transformation in healthcare industry to take new turns.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1476f2;"><a style="color: #1476f2;" href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/healthcare"><b>Devmind Healthcare Solutions</b></a></span></h2>
<p>Since healthcare and economic environments force medical experts to take extra shifts, this greatly affects their own quality and safety of life.</p>
<p>The idea behind Devmind’s solution was to empower medical professionals with a simple tool that gives them flexibility, control, and more. We created an <b>on-demand healthcare staffing solution</b> consisting of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">iOS and Android app with an Uber-like feel (for the Nurse role);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web Admin Panel (for Hospital Administrator or Security Supervisor role).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most significant features included there are a nurse and hospital management, shift management, notification center, data export, etc. Solutions of this kind can be a major stride within the current time frames because they help doctors stay focused on more essential things and certain patients with reaching for treatments.</p>
<p>As consumers and organizations have no other choice, the COVID-19 crisis is accelerating the utilization of digital platforms. While there have been financial, behavioral, and attitudinal<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2019185_telehealth_usage_and_awareness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> roadblocks</a> to adoption in the past, the need to overcome the crisis is superseding those roadblocks and increases the number of first-time users.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment"><b>E-commerce and Online Shopping</b></h2>
<p>Today, as B2B digital transformation statistics say, online shopping is the fastest-growing slice of the pie, dominating the scene and continuing to invest in digital capabilities.</p>
<p>Traditional, smaller players are also eyeing the online scene. Many traditional small markets have taken to online channels to hawk products, conduct online auctions, and even to carry out customer relation-building, for example, passing tips on how to prepare dishes using their products.</p>
<p>However, most authorities are warning organizations <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/interviews/coronavirus-spread-preparing-for-the-long-haul-i-4609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to prepare for the long haul</a>. Virtually every company involved in global trade feels the impact.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in B2B E-commerce</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Digitalization had swiftly come into B2B E-commerce sectors a long time ago. But since recent times the situation has drastically changed, the technologies and trends have changed too. Although some things remain untouchable. Still, most of the E-commerce sales are made through mobile devices (</span><a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/806336/mobile-retail-commerce-share-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">73%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">). Progressive Web App (PWA), with its native-app-like experience, is also here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Artificial intelligence, machine learning, personalized customer experience, and predefined analytics — all complement an evolution of B2B consumerization. Data remains the primary fuel for accelerating the development of any organization involved in sales. Focusing on eternal questions: what data to collect and how to process it effectively remains unsolved even today. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19718" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg" alt="social distancing" width="1200" height="1277" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-962x1024.jpg 962w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-768x817.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-600x639.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-423x450.jpg 423w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-940x1000.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In response to social distancing, many businesses will make their E-commerce operations a key priority.</em></p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Here is what we suggest you can do right now to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on your E-commerce business:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Even as early digitalization investments are paying off, the current inability to fulfill delivery of online purchases suggests digitization efforts by businesses have only been focused at the customer-facing end. Supermarket chains should consider integrating their online shopping platforms with the stock-holding information of their physical branches.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 may accelerate the growth of the online grocery sector. People did not just flock to physical supermarkets, but also loaded virtual carts with groceries from online platforms. With government directives to allow workers to work-from-home and to avoid non-essential trips to shopping malls, this trend of online shopping is likely to persist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Another possibility is for online shopping platforms to partner with businesses that specialize in delivery fulfillment such as UberEats, Grab, Glovo, and Bolt Food. B2B digital transformation trends are another milestone companies should consider today.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="entertainment"><b>Entertainment</b></h2>
<p>Around the world, COVID-19 is having a marked impact on media supply, consumption, and advertising. Demand for content-streamed, live, and multi-layered — is skyrocketing while new content creation has been largely turned off.</p>
<p>Since cinema and amusement parks across the globe are all shut down for uncertain times, thousands of entertainment organizations suffer formidable losses and fail to receive any kind of income. The outbreak triggered online entertainment and how some companies are finding ways to engage differently with consumers and the new reality.</p>

<h3>Digital Transformation in Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for all forms of media — TV programs, short-form video, music streaming, and online gaming, particularly in geographies currently under stay-home instructions, has surged. Digital transformation in entertainment is expecting more new turns in the foreseen future.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The supply of new content may be limited to a few weeks for some formats (e.g., daytime dramas). New TV series currently being launched were completed prior to production sets shutting down.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Network resiliency and capacity continues to be a focus, as the demand for content surges. In the European Union, streaming platforms are reducing video quality to ensure networks are not overwhelmed and that customers can still view content.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">While sports companies come to terms with a wave of cancellations, many are seeking new ways to reach their customers digitally. Many are looking to eSports or online simulated events to provide content to fans, with even professional athletes engaging in eSports competitions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Musicians are going online and relying on streaming platforms as live shows are canceled.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="food"><b>Restaurants and Food delivery</b></h2>
<p>Despite some concerns, food delivery companies gain their momentum and become a popular option as people practice social distancing. It&#8217;s hard to pinpoint exactly how much growth there has been in this sector, but higher demand has led to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-the-coronavirus-spreads-in-Zambia-food-delivery-companies-could-see-a-surge-in-demand-are-they-ready-2020-02-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher pricing</a> in some areas. What more to expect?</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Food Industry</h3>
<p>Uber, for example, recently provided Uber-only drivers with information on adding Uber Eats food deliveries to their services. Within the first week, around <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/increasing-earning-opportunities-with-uber-eats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15% of Uber drivers</a> had completed their first food delivery.</p>
<p>Fine dining establishments, small-town restaurants, and fast foods are now switching to offer delivery services to their customers. At the same time, restaurants that did not previously offer take-outs are now considering this option as never before. Some restaurants choose a third-party delivery service to partner with, and each offer comes with unique benefits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19710" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-scaled.jpg" alt="Uber eats Covid" width="2560" height="2048" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-768x614.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-600x480.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-450x360.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-1000x800.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>Uber Eats and Deliveroo, among others, have launched contactless “leave at your door service” to help drivers and customers follow social distancing and quarantine rules.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding already in place strict food hygiene <a href="https://trans.info/en/covid-19-pandemic-triggers-surge-in-global-food-delivery-industry-178243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards</a>, consumers may also be interested to learn if the businesses have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">New practices for social distancing in the kitchen or during delivery pickups;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Policy for staff members who display symptoms of COVID-19;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in food delivery guidelines, such as containers that allow for easier disinfection or better customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it is uncertain where the digital transformation in food industry and the delivery trend will go in the post-COVID-19 era, many businesses are working as hard as they can to ensure they meet consumers’ expectations and remain relevant by providing an excellent service.</p>
<h2 id="industry"><b>IT &amp; Tech Industry</b></h2>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 and are having <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/understanding-covid-19-s-impact-on-the-technology-sector-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant impact on the technology sector,</a> too. However, the disruption has caused reevaluation on organizations’ business continuity plans (BCPs) as well as the acceleration of remote operations and online meetings. Let&#8217;s dive in to see what has changed more and what solutions organizations appeal to remain afloat.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in IT and Other Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Companies with remote-working technologies already see increased demand as organizations accelerate their remote-working capabilities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Security software will see third-order benefits from a growing remote workforce. Organizations race to secure endpoints, cloud-based tools, log management, and VPNs. So, IT spending on security software will increase too.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19711" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg" alt="home teacher" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to enhanced remote work scenarios, IT digital transformation will play a larger role in future BCPs. Thus, CIOs and senior management will need to ensure a resilient, secure network, disaster recovery systems, and more devices for the ones working remotely.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for ever-faster access to data and automation will drive the focus on network equipment and communications, speeding up 5G network and equipment introduction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increase in the use of tele- and video-conferencing software as more companies encourage employees to commute.</span></li>

<h2 id="construction"><b>Construction</b></h2>
<p>Today, the most vulnerable industries are those lacking digitalization and tech maturity. The construction industry is one of them.</p>
<p>Creating $1.3 trillion worth of structures each year only in the USA, the construction industry remains one of the most under-digitized industrial sectors. Longer-term construction companies <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-s-impact-on-industrial-products---construction-firms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">across the globe</a> will have to contend with decreased demand as governments face rising deficits, and residential and commercial projects are dampened by unemployment and low GDP growth.</p>
<p>To stay one step ahead of the crisis, the sector requires a different approach to the overall strategy. Digital transformation in construction industry is a burning topic for both — senior management and government. What are the solutions construction companies have today?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Today, key questions executives and boards should be asking are: do we need to rethink our company’s digital strategy to remain financially solvent, and how can we use technology to gain operational leverage. And the digital transformation in the construction industry becomes inevitable.</p>

<h2 id="hospitality"><b>Hospitality</b></h2>
<p>Hospitality is taking proactive financial steps to mitigate the huge impact. It’s obvious today, both revenue and supply chains will be affected the most. Hotels, restaurants, theme parks, cinemas all went silent. The entire disruptive effect of the hospitality industry will have a significant, tremendous impact on the global hospitality industry and economy. And there is a question hangs heavy in the air — can digital transformation in hospitality industry change the rule of the game?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Despite this, hospitality shows its maturity level: in working together, showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can. Technologies like artificial intelligence, big data, connected devices, virtual and augmented realities are shaping the hospitality industry as we speak.</p>

<p>Only during the last two decades dozens of industry disruptors, such as Airbnb, Skyscanner, and TripAdvisor, have appeared on the market. Companies and organizations are expected to get out of the crisis more digitally mature, and those ones who find enough strength to focus on digitalization — are going to win the race. Here are some of the steps to consider today:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“We may be apart, but we&#8217;ll get through this together,” <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1538581578_Ju69Wm%2FOxIW8lBSY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Airbnb experts</a> introducing 50 new online experiences with unique activities for their customers. The home-sharing platform curates free online experiences to inspire people and stay afloat.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Digital transformation in the hospitality industry should now be focused on those that we know are available to travel. The dramatic rise in online gambling during COVID-19 lockdowns is one of the results of current circumstances. The online gambling industry is one of the winners of the current shutdown, and some offline casinos and other organizations can consider this as a potential opportunity for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Smart automation confidently moved into the industry through the Internet of Things technology. It has improved not only the convenience and comfort standards for clients but also reduced costs for businesses and organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Robots that handle food preparation and delivery, predictive analytics, and cloud storage — are the next big moves for automation in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the COVID-19 shutdown has brought the industry to a standstill, it is also an opportunity for the companies to reevaluate their digital strategies and map out the right path ahead.</p>

<p>Digital-only becomes the <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/new-research-illustrates-impact-of-covid-19-on-fintech-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new industry norm</a> in financial services, greatly accelerating a trend that started in the last decade. Digital transformation in FinTech triggers a “Big Pocket” battle between incumbents and challengers to win the (newly) online customer. Financial Institutions turn to Tech companies rather than in-house solutions to accelerate digital transformation.</p>

Some of which is here to stay with us in the long run. Some of which disappear right after the crisis is gone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19716" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw.png" alt="crisis Covid" width="1209" height="550" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw.png 1209w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-300x136.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-1024x466.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-768x349.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-600x273.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-450x205.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-1000x455.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1209px) 100vw, 1209px" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, some changes show a positive dynamic. For example, we see a greater focus on crisis preparedness, system resilience, social inequality, social solidarity, and access to health care. These attitudinal shifts could, in turn, be reflected in significant policy shifts in many areas, including trade, border controls, health care, crisis preparedness, foreign affairs, employment, and social welfare.</p>

Despite unfortunate reasons, it’s a great opportunity to <strong>challenge yourself, make your body look better, or maintain your regular routine before lockdown</strong>. Luckily, nowadays, we even don’t need to go to the gym to stay fit, thanks to mobile apps.</p>
<p>The statistic shows that the number of downloads of fitness apps has risen within the past few weeks. More people now have a chance to do things they’ve always postponed due to the lack of time or other reasons we come up with just not to exercise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the full impact of a novel pandemic is still unknown, many organizations are being impacted by the crisis domino effect, which reflects on employees, assets, operations, stakeholders, and even reputation.</p>
<p>Being proactive during disruption means that companies need to consider their business continuity preparedness activities and profound crisis management. This article is focused on risk identification and organizational exposure, on critical dependencies, and how to act pragmatically and effectively during crises and find resilience solutions.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Destructive behavioral models: before implementing any IT crisis management approach, make sure you choose the most reasonable scenario to act.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">IT crisis management examples in theory and in practice.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Test and tried IT crisis management strategies and how to activate them in order to survive on the market.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Crisis management in IT project: Dangerous behavioral models</h2>
<p>Humans manage IT businesses, so managers are likely to choose natural reactions in crisis. And this is dangerous! Such subconscious sweet escapes lead to controversial consequences to the companies. So, before trying any IT crisis management approach, ensure your behavior is not destructive first.</p>
<p>Psychologists distinguish three natural reactions to stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fight,</li>
<li>Flight, or</li>
<li>Freeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these behaviors are not rational but instinct-based. Thus, they significantly complicate your ability to succeed in crisis management in IT projects. But there is some good news: once acknowledged, you can neutralize them.</p>
<p>So, check yourself by completing our quick test.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19468" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6.png" alt="fight freeze" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>1. A person who fights in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You check the news and see what this world is coming to. Oil, financial crisis, coronavirus, worldwide quarantine, etc. This uncontrollable destruction makes you furious.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your common reaction to stress is arguing and rejecting the severity of the problem. You’re likely to think, “This coronavirus is just the flu. I prefer to disregard, close my eyes, and keep on working as usual.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you keep setting ambitious business aims, negotiating new strategies, and publishing aggressive ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve recognized yourself in this type of personality, calm down first. Everything will be back soon, but you need to act accordingly. We&#8217;re all victims of the circumstances here. In a crisis, we need to be even more flexible as usual. Don&#8217;t be stubborn, or the world will crush you down.</p>
<h3>2. A person who flight in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Once you face danger, you feel the urge to disappear. If the problems are increasing like a snow avalanche, you lose control over the situation. The severity of a crisis frightens you.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In a stressful situation, you want to close your eyes, run away from the city, and disappear with your family (or alone).</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you feel the urge to quit all the operational processes and cut all the costs. This may sound reasonable. But once uncontrolled, this behavior turns into destruction. And your team can find a strong reason to call you a deceiver.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re an escapist, realize that’s your unconscious behavior. Next time you feel the urge to run, just pause and take a deep breath. Remember: in crisis, your company needs a new strategy, and your team needs a real leader. If you choose to run away, you sign the death of your business.</p>
<h3>3. A person who freezes in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In any uncontrollable situation, you can’t decide how to react. You feel paralyzed and literally freeze in one place.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t act until you see what the next move the majority takes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you prefer to change nothing and see what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among these three instinctive reactions, freezing is the most reasonable scenario in shock. You don’t keep setting high aims in inappropriate circumstances. You&#8217;re not the one who closes everything and gives up without fighting. But you’re destroying your business if you literally sit and do nothing.</p>
<p>Whichever your natural reaction is, keep going slowly. And think of restructuring the business according to the new rules. It’s a high time to think of new opportunities, time-honored outsourcing strategies, and your life after the crisis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19469" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8.png" alt="life after crisis" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>4. I’m not fighting, running, or freezing. What’s my IT crisis management plan?</h3>
<p>Once you become aware of your instincts and ready to do a careful analysis, don’t expect to get a ready-to-use recipe from any article. When it comes to crisis management, any decision is tailor-made. Still, there are some common sense IT crisis management practices that work both in crisis and stable time. In this harsh reality, it’s time to remind them.</p>
<p>Remember the test above: the biggest mistake is to make any sudden movements. All your crisis decisions are contextual. Their magic power will end once people come back to the streets, and the world economy recovers. Of course, you can gain some profit by catching the moment today &#8211; but you will need to reinvent something in the long run. If you want to invest today in the future, think of the proper policies, technologies, and cost optimization approaches.</p>
<h2>Crisis management examples: Theory and Practice</h2>
<p>You can come back to books, searching for previously developed scenarios of how to act in today’s crisis. But they won’t help you. Nobody predicted the unique combination of all current troubles before &#8211; health threat because of coronavirus, social threat because of quarantine, and economic threat because of the financial crisis. You can collect the pieces of useful information in books, but nobody can tell you what to do exactly.</p>
<p>In its turn, the contemporary business practice has already shown one reliable truth: when all the expenses are rearranged, there’s one category that isn’t cut at any cost. This is digitalization, the constant driver for the innovations. When everybody is self-isolated, the Internet is the only communication channel left. And the demand for greater digitalization can be put at the core of IT crisis management strategic recovery for 2020.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19470" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7.png" alt="recovery for 2020" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Digitalization is a form of cooperation that can both save an offline company in these hard times and become a center of IT crisis management strategy.</h3>
<p>Once forced to become remote or die, the businesses will try their best to cover the lack of digital tools. To survive, many managers stop useless spending and turn to investing in their added business value. And here, IT companies become extremely helpful to them. Software is a solution for various offline operations needed today. The remote developers can create a fast and efficient delivery for coffee shops, implement an app for outfits from showrooms or orchestrate the remote working process for an office team. IT can manage the crisis by covering the basic demand for digitalization under the new market rules, in short.</p>
<p>With a proper mindset, a crisis is always an opportunity. But don’t be in a rush to catch any of them while in crisis.</p>
<h3>Think of cost optimization, not cost-cutting</h3>
<p>To survive and become great again, check if you’re ready for three IT directions on which future pivots:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on remote workplace optimization and dedicated development team creation,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting various forms of business process outsourcing &#8211; a traditional software development outsourcing company or its alternative forms: offshore software development, nearshore software development, or an outstaffing company,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing shared services and establishing effective collaboration models.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these models have been effective and highly recommended for all the companies during the last couple of years. But today, they are likely to help you stand this storm and become stronger after the crisis.</p>
<p>They work if only you had started adopting them before coronavirus conquered the world, of course.</p>

<h3>Remote workplace and dedicated development teams</h3>
<p>People all over the world stay home, but the majority of them keep working remotely. For years, remote developers have been hippies &#8211; but during quarantine, managers see the true value of a dedicated development team. The current situation is an opportunity for IT companies to organize micromanagement processes more effectively and build a team of highly motivated and talented people who can stand any crisis.</p>
<h3>Software development outsourcing company or the power of new collaboration models</h3>
<p>Introducing outsourcing software development is an effective strategy both in crisis and long after it passes. By finding a proper balance between in-house activities and outsourced operations, the cost optimization approach shows its best.</p>
<h3>Requesting offshore software development services (or how to optimize your expenses with offshore software development cost)</h3>
<p>Offshore model is among the real solutions to cost optimization during this crisis. This way, an offshore software development company can effectively reduce expenses for keeping an in-house team. Also, it allows fast hiring and fast scaling, which ensures the needed flexibility during the crisis.</p>
<h3>Nearshore software development model and IT outstaffing</h3>
<p>When you work remotely, the exact form of cooperation and the geographical location of your developers doesn’t matter that much. Additionally, you don’t need a separate budget to maintain an office. These models ensure high flexibility: they are project-based, provide managed services, and enable fast time-to-market delivery during the quarantine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19472" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6.png" alt="delivery chain" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Crisis management steps: Two strategic moves that will help you survive</h3>
<p>Let’s deal with it: you cannot change anything dramatically in the current situation. The best to do is to freeze and think of optimizing your costs. In the end, the 2020 crisis is nothing but a mistake to live through.</p>
<p>While steadily dealing with it, aim at reaching these two strategic goals:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your portfolio. Never depend on one product or project. Never rely on offline only, be ready to switch to another business development direction once needed. Prepare yourself for the worst scenario, and this will save your nerves and income figures.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Always have a rainy day fund. Your employees can live without extra entertainment in stable times &#8211; but in crisis, they will be happy to receive their salaries on time and not being fired.</li>
</ol>
<p>These strategies should be constant and gain different appearances in various IT processes. For example, you can teach your team the basics of remote productivity in stable times &#8211; and your remote developers will leave the next crisis more united than all in-house workers after quarantine. Cooperating with an outstaffing company in advance will teach your business to work with external collaborators and save your money for keeping in-house talents.</p>
<p>Remain constant in digitalization, no matter what tomorrow brings. Your digital workplace lives here.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19473" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4.png" alt="digital workplace" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>How two crisis management strategies will help you succeed in the future: The secret ingredient and the final thought</h3>
<p>Once you learn from today’s bitter experience, you are ready for future crises. But any tactical and strategic step won’t work without the proper background. The fundamental trait is the strength of your IT brand.</p>
<p>Your clients should love you and be ready to help once you need it. Invest in this, and enjoy the magic of their support.</p>
<p>Keep calm, optimize your costs, and be valuable by yourself. This way, you will survive any crisis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The profound humanitarian fallout of the COVID-19 continues to expand by the day. Governments have launched unprecedented public-health and economic responses. Companies have developed and implemented business continuity plans, security guidance, and, most importantly — seamless remote working conditions. In this article, we offer some of Devmind’s latest insights of managing a team of remote developers during times like this.</p>
<h1><b>How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h1>
<p>So here we are, living in a world where pandemic movies came to life. The number of ill people is rising, as well as the level of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Since March 16, our employees have been working remotely. We have already faced all the possible difficulties on our way and learned how to tackle the main challenges to manage the working process smart and effectively. We are ready to spill the beans and share all the secrets of productive remote management.</p>
<p>To stop COVID-19, all the countries around the world are trying to minimize human interactions, resulting in <strong>a staggering number of employees learning how to work remotely</strong>. Even though the majority of software engineers are not new to work like this, it can still be quite a challenge to manage a team in such difficult times psychologically.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19392 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg" alt="How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>That is why in this article, we are going to shed light on ten tips to organize an effective working process with remote developers, taking into account both psychological pitfalls and practical hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><b>How to Manage a Team of Remote Developers Despite the Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to outline all the possible challenges your software development team may face when working from home. Usually, it boils down to three main challenges. These are communication problems and pitfalls, lack of well-functioned equipment, and the inability to manage productivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, before setting out the rules, guidelines, and software development team goals, make sure you did your best to eliminate or alleviate the possible struggles that may occur.</p>
<h2><b>10 Tips To Keep Your Developers Team Effective During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h2>
<p>Luckily, we have already examined the best cases of smart and efficient remote developers management and prepared a quick guide for you to follow. We have taken into consideration the main challenges that can be difficult to tackle and offering comprehensive solutions to the problem. Take a look and enjoy the tips that truly work.</p>
<h3><b>1. Secure a Well-Functioned Tech Facilities and Tools</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need some software that will unite all the working processes. To ensure productivity, you’d better have a look at <strong>various collaboration tools perfect for a software development team working remotely.</strong>  Such tools as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/ru/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=77960797405&amp;campaign=1495118561&amp;creative=389415003358&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p48956357108&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1u6J2htFRXh6wNFyzNse_aL_oTmPCvKEjPuVZYAT10fuV645yZsumIaAieOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> enable us to stay focused on daily tasks, plan and manage projects. Slack helps our team to stay connected all the time. It’s the place where we <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-team-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainstorm</a> and solve current issues. And Zoom, as a perfect alternative to Skype, is a way more convenient tool to have video calls and screen sharing.</p>
<p>What is more, there are tons of <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/tools-for-remote-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity tools</a> that are both efficient and have friendly interfaces like Todoist, iDoneThis, and Atlassian Stash. With the help of such systems, it is much easier to have an overall picture needed when working remotely.</p>
<h3><b>2. Make Sure Your Staff Have Everything for Effective Work</b></h3>
<p>But for the obvious essentials like a well-function computer or a laptop and great Internet connection, one should think through all the possible hurdles on the way to a smooth remote working process. Ensure that you have <strong>a backup to the cloud in case there is any accidental deletion of valuable files. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, your workers need to have “<a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/secure-collaboration-remote-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a> to servers, development environments, and shared code.” Otherwise, your software developers teams will just stumble upon inconveniences that could lower their productivity.</p>
<h3><b>3. Think Through Communication Channels</b></h3>
<p>Even though many people hate these real face-to-face meetings, during such gatherings, you can communicate fast, transmit your ideas fast, and, most importantly, solve the existing problems fast. When working with remote developers, it is vital to have <strong>regular video meetings.</strong> Not only will regular conferences reduce the problem with the lack of information, but they also help to unite workers and show they are all in this together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19388 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg" alt="Think Through Communication Channels During Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><b>4. Help Your Workers With Self-Organization</b></h3>
<p>If you want your developers’ team to be productive, you need to show them the importance of <strong>self-organization and discipline</strong>. Teach them to stay online during the working day. What is more, be a great example and don’t bother them with work issues at weekends and when the working day has ended.</p>
<p>Explain that the remote work schedule is no different from work in the office, and this is actually the good news. The reason is simple: you work the same amount of time, but you don’t waste your time commuting, for instance. What is more, psychologically it is less stressful when you do your job within the agreed time period, having no put offs, and then just relax after the work is done.</p>
<h3><b>5. Set Software Development Team Roles and Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>Make sure both formal and informal roles are distributed effectively so that each employee knows exactly what their responsibilities are. When working remotely, a team <strong>“can truly benefit from having informal roles like various kinds of leaders, idea generators, critics, and doers”</strong>, as it is the key to self-management.</p>
<p>Plus, it is worth mentioning that to maximize productivity, you’d better build small teams of <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-8 people</a>. Such teams are more autonomous, take responsibility for their initiatives, and as a result, are more efficient. In case you’re developing a big project, you can always divide one team into sub-teams.</p>
<h3><b>6. Keep Everyone Updated</b></h3>
<p>When working together on one project, it is crucial that <strong>all the members are in the loop</strong>, especially in the case of remote developers. For this reason, once again, think through regular conference meetings to discuss the relevant issues. Knowing the status of other projects, or being aware of any changes in the company’s goals and objectives is all crucial to an employee working remotely. That is why ensure that nobody is missing out on anything.</p>
<h3><b>7. Encourage Open Conversation </b></h3>
<p>Let us face reality, COVID-19 is not the usual flu, and it has been a long time since the last serious pandemic. That is why all the people are feeling stressed, anxious, and some can even get depressed. An employer or HR manager encourages open conversation with your workers. Make sure you ask your workers how they feel.</p>
<p><strong>“It is <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/7-tips-for-working-fsuccessfully-managing-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed</a> that the main struggle remote workers face is the feeling of loneliness and isolation”.</strong> For this reason, it would be a great idea to offer an opportunity for an online session with the psychologist. After all, you are working with people, and their emotional and physical being is the main priority.</p>
<h3><b>8. Remind About Data Protection</b></h3>
<p>Ensure that your employees are informed about protecting data. Remind them that it isn’t advisable to transfer work data, materials, and emails to their personal devices without permission. In case they do not have any other choice but to work on their personal laptop or computer, make sure that they <strong>take all the necessary precautions</strong> like antivirus software or not letting the browsers save some work passwords, for instance.</p>
<p>What is more, you should ensure <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/software-teams/how-to-keep-your-remote-software-development-team-safe-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure connections</a> with VPN, as well as adopt smart and secure cloud storage solutions.</p>

<h3><b>9. Trust Your Developers Team</b></h3>
<p>If you want to create a comfortable and efficient working environment, it is not about tracking and monitoring productivity all the time or comparing the performance. <strong>It is about believing in your team</strong>, talking to them, and taking an interest in what bothers them. After all, it does not matter whether you work from home or stay in the office. If a team achieves the required outcome, it means they are doing a great job.</p>
<h3><b>10. Goals Are the Priority, Not Activity</b></h3>
<p>According to Forbes contributor Donal Hatter, who specializes in sales and effective leadership, <strong>it is crucial to focus on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/30/top-15-tips-to-effectively-manage-remote-employees/#62a35f47503c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objectives</a> when working with a remote team.</strong> He believes that productivity boils down to the results having been achieved, rather than what is being done. For this reason, the last tip is to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your team and work towards them no matter the obstacles.</p>
<h1><b>How to Motivate and Manage Remote Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis </b></h1>
<p>Believe it or not, humanity has always been facing this or that crisis. However, the main advantage of the human race is the ability to adapt to any kind of change or environment. That is why getting used to working remotely is also just a matter of time and, in fact, is the future of work.</p>
<p>Embrace such an opportunity to build strong functionality even when your employees are not under control in the office. Be there for them, be consistent, and set clear goals. Use all the abundance of online tools to do work as productive as offline, or even better as <a href="https://www.inc.com/stephen-denny/3-ways-to-inspire-innovation-from-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working remotely</a> today may be the key to innovation tomorrow.</p>

<h1>1. A challenging landscape</h1>
<p>As a typical “black swan” event, COVID-19 took the world by complete surprise. This newly identified coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, on December 31, 2019. As we almost enter April 2020, the virus has infected over 700,000 people, led to more than 30,000 deaths, and has spread to more than 200 countries.</p>
<p>The focus of most businesses is now on protecting employees, understanding the risks to their business, and managing the supply chain disruptions caused by the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of this epidemic on businesses is still unknown. However, one thing is certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Optimizing costs is a perennial, continuous cross-enterprise effort organizations take into consideration now more than ever. <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/driving-cost-optimization-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost optimization</a> is a critical imperative for any functional leader, but its execution and impact reach far beyond the limits of any single functional area.</p>
<p><b>Cost optimization should not be confused with budget reductions. </b>When undertaking budget reductions, functional leaders — be they marketing leads, supply chain managers, business unit directors or technology team leaders — are often asked only to hit budget reduction targets within their own departments. While a more holistic, enterprise wide approach may be beneficial, the ability of functional leaders to impact areas outside their control is often limited.</p>
<p>Organizations should approach cost optimization as an expansive effort that can have both immediate and long-term significance for business performance. To truly serve the enterprise, cost optimization demands a mix of improvements that touch every part of the enterprise.</p>
<h1>2. Under-digitized businesses are hard-hit</h1>
<p>Businesses that are currently struggling for profitability — those with low or unstable cash reserves — are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-germany/featured-topics/cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Predicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even businesses that appear to be in good financial shape may not be immune, depending on how the situation progresses. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment and air transportation have been particularly hard-hit in the short term.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19345 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg" alt="industries that suffer the most" width="1235" height="596" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-600x290.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-450x217.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1000x483.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Businesses in consumer goods and retail may also be at higher- than-normal financial risk, especially those in seasonal businesses where demand may be lost (as opposed to shifted), such as such perishable consumer goods and seasonal apparel. Even commodity-oriented industries, such as metals and mining or oil and gas, are exposed as global demand shifts and pricing fluctuates.</p>
<h1>3. Building blocks for change: cost optimization initiatives</h1>
<p>Given the importance of managing cash flows in times like this, companies should immediately develop a <b>plan for cost optimization as part of their overall business risk and </b><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/business-continuity-efforts-in-response-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>continuity plans</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>In doing so, it is essential to take a full ecosystem perspective, as the approaches you take to manage cash will have implications for not only your business but also for your customers.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19351 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg" alt="IT cost optimization pic" width="1235" height="887" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-768x552.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-600x431.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-450x323.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1000x718.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Borrowing from the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the 2008 recession and credit crunch, and the last black swan event to significantly impact global economy — the Japanese earthquake of 2011 — we see the following practices and strategies as worth considering today.</p>
<p>Among them: ensuring your own financing remains viable, focusing on the cash-to-cash conversion cycle, thinking like a CFO, revisiting your variable costs and capital investment plans, extending payables, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Shared services, business process outsourcing, </b><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/dci9/documents/gartner-infrastructure-operations-cloud-india-cost-optimization-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>automation of IT operations</b></a> — all these components offer considerable cost saving opportunities. Enterprise cost optimization priorities — to preserve revenue, continue to innovate and keep the best staff — often conflict with the cost reduction priorities of functional leaders, which are to reduce costs quickly with as little disruption as possible.</p>
<h1>4. Five areas of focus for the enterprise</h1>
<p>While there is a great amount of functional variability in how leaders approach cost optimization, five areas of focus allow leaders in various roles and business units to pursue beneficial optimization (see the figure mentioned below).</p>
<h2>1) Benchmark to get a baseline</h2>
<p>The use of comparative metrics is a key aspect of any effective cost optimization campaign. <b>Benchmarks help leaders analyze their environments to discover what resources and initiatives may require additional funding or optimization.</b></p>
<p>Benchmarks also showcase areas of strategic investment. But care is required, as benchmarks can easily be misused.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19347 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg" alt="cost optimization across enterprise" width="1235" height="957" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-600x465.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-450x349.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1000x775.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<h2>2) Identify critical points in the budget to shield</h2>
<p>To bring more clarity to the optimization decision-making process, companies should identify:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">the potential financial benefit;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business impact;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business risk;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">time requirement of candidate cost optimization projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of impact, the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/services/gx-deloitte-global-cost-management-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost optimization initiative</a> is partly contingent on whether business unit leaders and their staff are capable of changing and adapting to new approaches and processes.</p>
<p>For example, optimization may involve frontline systems and tool automation as part of their business processes. What does this adaptation mean when leaders consider implementation and training timeframes?</p>
<p>To gain CEO or CFO approval for an initiative, leaders can describe a business case showing how the <b>cost optimization initiative will improve such criteria as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business processes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-to-market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The like, as opposed to continuing with the status quo.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria points offer a suitable framework for prioritizing which line items are worth preserving, and which projects are worth supporting.</p>
<h2>3) Identify noncritical points to eliminate</h2>
<p>Just as crucial to the decision-making process is the identification of aspects of the business that can be eliminated or reduced. These changes will be primarily quantifiable as reductions in expense, but, again, leaders should consider the significance of each point to the business. An enterprise&#8217;s position within the growth model — growing, mature or declining — serves as an initial driver for identifying and prioritizing cost optimization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growing companies have a higher tendency to <b>standardize and simplify IT- enabled capabilities in order to optimize costs</b> and meet business goals for matching service levels to customer demand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mature enterprises typically respond to cost optimization goals with investment-based programs. </b>These programs aim to automate or utilize capabilities at lower capacity costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Determine cost optimization approach</h2>
<p>Several options exist for optimization, including reduction of costs, reduction of demand, and a balance of short- and long-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Some categories of optimization functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Instituting emergency cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Applying selective cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving costs and business value.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing costs for added business value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5) Communicate plans to stakeholders and lead the organization through the change</h2>
<p>The leader of a cost optimization program will be in constant contact with all business areas. Communication of best practices should always include details of the practice and expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Leaders can also offer a list of alternative options that were considered, along with detailed explanations outlining why the alternative options were not selected.</p>
<h1>5. Accelerating through cost-efficient remote work</h1>
<p>A virtual remote workforce enables organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive growth and better serve customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increase business productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Attract top talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only remote work enables organizations to shift labor costs to lower cost resources, cut travel and expense budgets, and reduce fixed facility costs, but also a virtual workforce gives organizations a greater degree of flexibility to take advantage of lower cost labor regardless of location — and engage workers only when and where the business needs. For example, many workers sourced from outlying areas and offshore locations, such as Lusaka have significantly lower wages than similarly qualified resources.</p>
<p>From Google to Ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to work from home in a bid to stem the spread of pandemic. Such remote working at scale is unprecedented and will leave a lasting impression on the way people live and work for many years to come. What companies need in uncertain times is a collaborative mindset and the ability to map and analyze the value created deep within employee networks.</p>
<h1>6. Collaborative models and dedicated teams value</h1>
<p>Although collaboration is one of the most crucial components of modern businesses, most companies still do not know how to get the most out of it. Here are some of the <b>collaborative models tactics we apply here, at Devmind:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The team members from different time zones are not assigned for one micro task.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are organized between each other to ensure “rolling style” execution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All developers work shifted hours to ensure the best possible communications.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work time designed so that all teams have 2 hours of overlap with regular PST work time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Overlaps are used for daily scrums, any meetings and informal collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19346" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg" alt="distributed teams" width="1235" height="833" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1000x674.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>What companies need in a collaborative age is the ability to map and analyze the value created within employee networks. These networks should focus on both — individual and organizational effectiveness and on the value the interactions between employees and companies are created.</p>
<p>To make these interactions more useful, executives must reorient them toward the revenue and productivity benefits that collaborative models generate, the costs such interactions impose, and opportunities to improve connectivity at the points that create the greatest economic value.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Teams As More Cost-Effective Approach for Under-Digitized Businesses</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/dedicated-development-team-reimagined-and-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated team model</a> aims to provide a client with the right developers regardless of wherever the developers and the client are, and negotiate a mode of cooperation: nearshore (in close proximity to the client), onshore (on the client’s premises), or offshore (remotely).</p>
<p>Moreover, dedicated teams are known for their flexibility, niche skills, high scaling velocity, and high loyalty. As dedicated teams offer immense flexibility, the client has a lot of space to be efficient with their budget. The key industries that look for dedicated team approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthcare</a> (among them a lot of pharmaceutical companies);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/hospitality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel &amp; hospitality</a>;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/ar-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19352 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="1033" height="462" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png 1033w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-300x134.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1024x458.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-768x343.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-600x268.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-450x201.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1000x447.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /></p>
<h1>7. Beyond pandemic: risks and security</h1>
<p>For some organizations, survival is the only way of implementing things today. Others are crawling through the fog of uncertainty, guessing what’s next, where should be the next turn, when things get back to normal. The question is, what will new normal look like?</p>
<p>No one can answer this question for sure now. But what we believe we can state is that the new normal is already here. The pandemic has made it harder for companies to maintain risks and so — the security and stability of their operations and even survival mode. But new tactics can help leaders to safeguard their people and organizations.</p>
<p>We, at Devmind, empower companies and their workforces with digital transformation services and approaches to help them survive during these times. Are you and your organization looking for it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The novel 2020 pandemic takes every sphere of human activity into the next level. Financial institutions are forced to move quickly to protect their employees, transform their operations, and serve customers in new, improved ways.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry.</li>
<li>Digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers.</li>
<li>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19371" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="The Future Of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, more and more organizations will miss their financial targets because of strategic and operational disruptions and dampened customer demand. It’s also unclear how long COVID-19 will last. But one sure thing is here — this will not be a short-term event with fewer consequences. Industries, such as banking, should prepare for the long haul.</p>
<p>However, the software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry. Digital transformation in banking has already started, and now we can see some changes like 24/7 online banking and instant transactions.</p>
<p>Still, the process in this sphere is quite slow. To begin a journey to digital transformation, institutions have to develop a detailed strategy to change their distribution model, revise and enhance value offers, as well as develop end-to-end customer-centered processes that can result in growth and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are a number of technologies available nowadays that can help in the process of the digital transformation of the banking field. Good digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers. Among the trending technology solutions, we can distinguish:</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>AI in banking is represented by chatbots or online assistants that help customers with their issues by providing necessary information or executing different transactions. Apart from this, AI can be used for the purpose of data analysis and security. For instance, identify money laundering by analyzing customer data within several seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of blockchain in banking can result in a better interface, more accuracy, and secured data and transactions. In addition, blockchain solutions will make transactions and different operations transparent, facilitating collaboration. There will be no need for the intermediation of the third parties, thus bringing up the level of trust from the customers. It can also influence cloud technologies and move to decentralized ones, which will result in higher protection of the data and funds.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></p>
<p>IoT is helpful with real-time data analysis, thus makes the customer experience more personal, and banks are able to provide individually-tailored offers. What is more, thanks to wearables, customers can easily and seamlessly make contactless payments. Apart from this, IoT is helpful with risk management and access to platforms; the authentication process can be supported by biometric sensors that make access more secure and protected.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></p>
<p>Cloud computing is another technology that can help banks become more efficient and gives them a chance to provide more innovations, as well as have better productivity, improve operations, and instantaneously deliver products and services. Cloud computing, as well as IoT, can help with risk management and create a secure environment for the customers and internal bank systems.</p>
<p>All in all, the digital transformation of the banking field will bring great innovations that will change the image of banks we know nowadays. Technologies bring numerous opportunities both for banks and their customers by securing personal data, increasing transparency, and giving a chance to manage funds anytime and anywhere.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Investment Banking</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19372" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Investment Banking" width="660" height="310" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-300x141.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-600x282.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-450x211.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Despite all the benefits brought by digital transformation in banking, investment banking is going to face some challenges in the current environment. Investment banking doesn’t take deposits and functions as a facilitator between buyers and sellers and keeps data protected.</p>
<p>As we have already discussed, the rise of digital solutions in banking can result in increased data transparency, elimination of intermediates in the process, and alternative methods to access financial and intellectual data. All this can result in lower pricing on the operations and make transactions easier and faster. Investment banks can be replaced by a group of small investors brought together at one digital platform. The occurrence of new players in the niche (for instance, fintech companies), eliminating entry barriers, and disintermediation can put investment banks in dire straits.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not all doomed, as there always will be a need for professional advice on complex operations and big deals. In order to survive in this competing world, the investment banks should think of the ways to use available data and skills in the digitalized world.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Retail Banking</h2>
<p>Retail banks have more opportunities in comparison with investment banks, but still, the journey to digital transformation is rather long and requires a lot of resources. First of all, in order to succeed, their strategy should be customer-centered. Banks possess a lot of important data that can be used as a background for new innovative solutions and services that can satisfy customers to the full.</p>
<p>Technologies like blockchain and AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be of great advantage if the bank wants to survive competition with fintech companies, online banks, and non-financial platforms that provide exact services to their customers and have more advantages over traditional banks. These tools can automate numerous manual operations, thus enhance customer satisfaction. Also, AI and IoT can be used together to collect and analyze personal data of the customers for the banks to create more personalized offers.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges for retail banks in this situation can be to find a professional team or create an inner IT department. But thanks to the available platforms and outsource companies, this issue can be easily overcome.</p>
<h2>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>Digital transformation of the banking institutions brings a lot of new opportunities for the customers, individual ones, small companies, and huge corporations, as well as banks themselves. Clever strategy and constant improvements can result in a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience<br />
</strong>Personal and company bank accounts are available at any device, the only things you need are an Internet connection and a few taps on the screen. This brings more customer satisfaction as they are able to constantly keep on track of their account balance and manage the information on their personal profile (add new mailing address, e-mails, telephone numbers, etc.). In addition to this, there is no need to go to the bank to get checks as they can be instantly sent to your email address.</li>
<li><strong>24/7 Service<br />
</strong>Online banking services are available 24/7 all year round, even at the weekends. There is no need to stay in lines and wait for the bank to open in order to conduct certain operations. It’s a huge advantage that comes with digital solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Saving<br />
</strong>Another advantage, you save a lot of time as you have access to the account from home. It is extremely convenient as previously you could waste an hour or two at the bank to make simple operations, and now it is done seamlessly from home or any other place where there is an Internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Transfers<br />
</strong>Direct banks can provide unlimited automated transfers (accept payroll deposits or provide automatic bill payment) with no additional fees for the services even to outside financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Management<br />
</strong>Online accounts can be easily managed, although they require more information than traditional banks. Customers can add information themselves or directly contact online assistants to provide support on the current issue. What is more, payee information is retained within the system, there is no need to re-enter data for the following payments, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the advantages are impressive, and they facilitate the work to a great extent, there are still some disadvantages that follow the process. Here are the main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Issues<br />
</strong>Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues that companies and institutions are struggling to overcome. Even sophisticated software that protects tentative data cannot completely protect accounts from scammers, phishing, hacker attacks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Services<br />
</strong>Nowadays, not all banks can offer a wide range of online services. Still, there are some that require your presence at the traditional banks.</li>
<li><strong>Transactions<br />
</strong>Complex transactions may also require the presence at the bank office. Also, international transactions are not possible with all digital banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of disadvantages is rather low, and it’s only a matter of time for them to disappear. Advantages take over disadvantages and make daily operations much easier, reduce costs, save customer’s time, and manage to provide services efficiently.</p>
<h2>Challenges Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers. But today banks face certain challenges that are difficult to overcome:</p>
<h3>Competition With Non-Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Amazon is trying to provide banking opportunities to its customers. Facebook allows users to make transfers directly to other people’s bank accounts, thus leaving banks out of the process. But banks are more regulated institutions, thus more secure. It is important for them to go digital quicker.</p>
<h3>Online Payments</h3>
<p>Not every bank can support online/mobile or contactless payments. The reason for this is that a bank cannot provide another option but physical payment as it doesn’t have a secure online platform, resources, and skilled team to make it possible. It gets even harder to compete with available online services like ApplePay and PayPal.</p>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>The system that provides online banking services should be constantly updated and have an efficient security level. Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues nowadays that banks should take into consideration first of all. Again, in order to overcome this challenge, the bank has to set up a detailed strategy, choose appropriate technologies and find a professional team that can easily turn ideas into reality with the latest software and available tools.</p>
<p>The process of digital transformation is rather endless as technologies enhance, the systems should be constantly updated. New technologies will give a chance for new services to appear that again will require constant upgrade and support.</p>
<p>Digital transformation in banking is going to speed up in the upcoming years. Financial institutions should take into account the current state of affairs, work out a profound strategy, and use the right tools in order to succeed in the future.</p>
<p>The transformation journey is not an easy thing and involves a lot of resources, but as a result, the services could be more secured and delivered quicker, and most of all, enhance the level of customer satisfaction. As technologies develop and enhance, the banking industry will also get better and better year by year.</p>
