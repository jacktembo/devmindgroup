										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 23, Devmind’s top experts of the Construction Industry went live for a 40-minute webinar to discuss how construction leaders should act now to think one step ahead of the current crisis.</p>
<p>Our experts weigh in on the latest research and trends to help to imagine the perfect digitization phases for one building development and more effective, affordable, and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>The “Digital Transformation in Construction. Thinking One Step Ahead” tackled the areas of implementation, real-life examples, constraints, and more regarding the potential digital transformation steps as different layers or dimensions of the BIM repository and other essential tools.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Watch The Video:</b></a></h2>
<p><iframe title="Webinar: Digital Transformation in Construction" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a65aj-SD0FA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Digitalization as XD Roadmap</h2>
<p>Digital transformation in the construction industry is not just a nice to have thing from a design, estimating, and safety perspective. It is also becoming a part of state regulations in most developed countries.</p>
<p>During the webinar, we considered the adoption of 3D and CAD modeling as the base-level and reviewed all other D’s to 8D as a new layer or dimension added new Interactions between parties, collaboration opportunities, and other benefits.</p>
<p>Talking about the ecosystem, there were five parties of system interactions: customers who would be a project owner, a cost control department, management including Project and Operations managers, third-party vendors and contractors, and engineers and developers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19912" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg" alt="webinar roadmap " width="1563" height="1177" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg 1563w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-768x578.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-600x452.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-450x339.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1000x753.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1563px) 100vw, 1563px" /></p>
<p>In the 3D case, our base level, we assumed that all designing and engineering work is done in 3D. So all initial project documentation right from the start is digital. We have Architects and Engineers collaborating and sharing on the system. The 4th dimension or 4D case would be time.</p>
<p>In the particular version the BIM repository adds:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Planning and Estimation;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration with construction management tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Documents, Materials, and Phases approvals workflows;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Deep integration with Design and construction simulation tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the 5th dimension, we would add costs. In the 6th layer, we add even more parties and control to the system. The 7th dimension is all about post-production management, operations, and reconstruction. And finally, the last 8th dimension is safety during the project and after it is completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch Webinar</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 quarantine got us like we are all watching another ‘Black Mirror’ episode. Though it is the reality, we’re living in, and many of us start learning how to get the best of it.</p>

<h2><b>What is an online</b><b> learning platform?</b></h2>
<p>Generally, an E-learning platform <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-is-an-online-learning-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a portal or a learning environment that enables a person to get educational content or/and online instructions on a particular topic</a>. The format of the content can vary presentations, video lectures, webinars, quizzes, articles, and even educational jokes. What is more, depending on a platform, you can get access for free with/without registration, or you will need to pay for membership/or courses. In other words, an online learning platform is a space with endless opportunities to acquire comprehensive knowledge via easy-to-use and engaging tools.</p>
<h2><b>What are the</b><b> best online learning platforms?</b></h2>
<p>In the list below, we have reviewed and picked the best e-learning portals in 2020.

<h3><b>Top Online Learning Platforms: </b><b>Final Words</b></h3>
<p>No doubt, E-learning is paving its way to shape the way we see education and is no longer perceived as something trivial. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/31/e-learning-climbing-to-325-billion-by-2025-uf-canvas-absorb-schoology-moodle/#133485633b39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">By 2025 E-learning is predicted to reach revenue of $325 billion.</a> The demand for engaging and interactive learning is rising, and these days learning platforms online can rise again sharply, leaving traditional institutions behind.</p>
<p>Among the main reasons why online learning continues gaining its popularity are affordability, interactivity, and relevance. Generally, massive institutions are falling behind, being unable to adjust the curriculum and the scope of knowledge fast. Nowadays, the demand for particular skills can change overnight, and online platforms can tailor the courses way quicker to meet the needs of learners. Not to mention, the new challenge of being isolated and having to study from home during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Summing up, quarantine exposed people to many problems, and education has become one of them. However, thanks to endless opportunities open online, not only can we tackle the challenge, but we can also reap all the benefits of having flexible schedules and acquiring relevant knowledge.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How many top-rated TV apps do you really know?</h2>
<p>Indeed, how many? The majority knows Netflix and YouTube. Some others will recall Amazon and Disney, probably. But only a couple of people realize there are at least 15 excellent TV apps you can enjoy this season.</p>
<p>When you stay home and have plenty of free time because of COVID-19, the most obvious lifestyle is to lay on a couch, watch movies or TV series, and wait until this disaster is over. You are likely to get bored with this pretty fast.</p>
<p>And if this quarantine has shown any clear thing about Netflix, it is that this streaming service is not perfect. YouTube is also an unreliable partner — especially after the news that the streaming quality of this service is lower than usual now.</p>

</ol>

<h2>The leader of top Apple TV apps</h2>
<h3 id="netflix">#1 Netflix</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19836 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11.png" alt="Netflix TV apps" width="1310" height="681" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11.png 1310w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-300x156.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-1024x532.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-768x399.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-600x312.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-450x234.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-1000x520.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" /></p>
<p>Netflix is the leader in the streaming industry. It rocks not only the rating of TV apps but also the list of top apps for Apple TV (leaving far behind Apple TV Plus, for example). If you want to enjoy high-quality video content, subscribe to Netflix.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Up to 6 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $8.99 per month (Basic), $12.99 per month (Standard), $15.99 per month (Premium)</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list: </b></p>
<p>+ Supports all the top platforms</p>
<p>+ The breathtaking collection of Netflix originals</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Paid subscription only</li>
</ul>
<p>According to TCL, the leading streamer in the USA, Netflix is the most used TV app in the country (not a surprise). Of course, Netflix is cool, and you don’t need this guide to learn its value. At the same time, there’s still some room for improvement.</p>
<p>Netflix has premium status in the world of TV apps, so you must pass the procedure of signing in and paying to watch the videos. Not everybody likes it.</p>
<p>Netflix library cannot cover all the videos you might be interested in. Even though it offers over 100,000 hours of watching, some content types are absent from Netflix. So, the fans of live sports, classic movies, and news have already found better alternatives. The same applies to people interested in free streaming.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Netflix originals cover all the possible flaws of this platform. Subscribe to enjoy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/netflix/id363590051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download from AppStore.</a></p>
<h3 id="youtube">#2 YouTube TV</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19834 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9.png" alt="Youtube TV apps" width="1295" height="678" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9.png 1295w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9-300x157.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9-1024x536.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9-768x402.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9-600x314.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9-450x236.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image9-1000x524.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1295px) 100vw, 1295px" /></p>
<p>Everyone loves YouTube, and its YouTube TV experience is highly enjoyable. The service works cable-free, works on numerous devices, and has a huge library of broadcasts available.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams: </b>Up to 3 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $12 per month</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding massive library</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Compatible with numerous devices</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">High subscription price</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube is another obvious choice for top TV apps. Containing all sorts of videos, YouTube TV service offers to download and watch them later offline.</p>
<p>The streaming on YouTube TV is free of advertisement after you pay for the subscription.</p>
<p>As a choice for Fire TV, YouTube TV enables browsing by interest area, connecting your device with several accounts, searching by voice, and playing 4K video.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-tv/id1193350206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download from AppStore.</a></p>
<h3 id="amazon">#3 Amazon Prime Video</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19827 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2.png" alt="Amazon TV apps" width="1289" height="657" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2.png 1289w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-300x153.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-768x391.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-600x306.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-450x229.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-1000x510.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1289px) 100vw, 1289px" /></p>
<p>Amazon Prime Video is also a leader in the TV streaming market. The application is a real competitor to Netflix and a second choice for most movie admirers.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $12 per month / $119 per year</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<p>+ Supports all the top platforms</p>
<p>+ Offers unique content (Amazon originals)</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Paid subscription only</li>
</ul>
<p>According to TCL, Amazon Prime Video is the #3 choice for the U.S. citizens aged 35-54. Generally, the TV app is popular all over the world. In its library, you can find different types of content: movies, TV shows, documentaries, Amazon originals, and live TV streams.</p>
<p>It seems like a nice alternative to Netflix originals if you want to try something different.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-prime-video/id545519333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download from AppStore.</a></p>
<h3 id="hulu">#4 Hulu</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19833 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8.png" alt="Hulu TV apps" width="1408" height="683" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8.png 1408w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-300x146.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-1024x497.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-768x373.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-600x291.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-450x218.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image8-1000x485.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" /></p>
<p>Hulu is an app where you can watch thousands of TV shows and movies. Also, the content types include sports and news upon subscription.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> 2 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $5.99 per month</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>

<p>The library of Disney Plus consists of 5 content hubs: Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, and National Geographic. If you want to be the first in catching the trends like Baby Yoda, this TV app is for you!</p>
<p>In the family of Disney TV products, you can also install Disney Channel!, Disney Junior!, and Disney XD.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Google Chromecast, iOS, Xbox One, Android, Apple TV, PS4, Amazon, and Android TV</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Up to 4 devices in 4K resolution free</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $6.99 per month/ $69.99 per year (USA); $8.99 per month/ $89.99 per year (Canada and Australia); €6.99 per month / €69.99 per year (EU countries)</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Offers 7 days of a free trial</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Contains the complete library of Disney movies (old and fresh)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Supports only Roku (no Samsung or LG TV compatibility)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A limited collection of movies</li>
</ul>
<p>The TV application Disney created arranges in one place the House of Mouse, Star Wars, Pixar, and Marvel planets. But the most important, of course, is the guaranteed access to all the beloved good-old Disney movies. Only this fact is worth paying all the money asked for the subscription!</p>
<p>But of course, if you are a TV app user whose interests expand further than Disney movie library, this offering is too limited for you.</p>
<p>Disney Plus provides its subscribers a unique opportunity to watch new Disney content without the need to attend traditional cinema premier day. For the Coronavirus lockdown, this fact is a truly needed know-how.</p>

<h2>The best picks among top Fire TV apps</h2>
<h3 id="plex">#12 Plex</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19837 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12.png" alt="Plex TV apps" width="1367" height="694" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12.png 1367w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-300x152.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-1024x520.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-768x390.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-600x305.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-450x228.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image12-1000x508.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1367px) 100vw, 1367px" /></p>
<p>Plex is among the top apps for Fire TV, fitting the functionality of this platform perfectly. Its library is really huge and features Bollywood movies, rare documentaries, and musicals.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> Android, iOS, Roku, LG Smart TV, Amazon Alexa, Sony Smart TV, Toshiba Smart TV, PlayStation 4, Vizio, Xbox One</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Up to 3 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $4.99 per month / $39.99 per year</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Great UX</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Huge compatibility list</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Not that many streams among them can work simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p>MakeUseOf magazine lists Plex as a top remote app for TV streaming on Fire TV. We couldn’t omit this app from our overview as well.</p>
<p>Plex is a great choice for streaming movies from your library on different devices around your house. If you decide to go for Plex Pass, you won’t need an Internet connection to play those videos.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Plex is that you can download it from Amazon Appstore. As an Android TV app, the installation process requires a Plex server. It should be on another laptop that connects to your Android device through Wi-Fi. After that, Plex will play your files instantly, without using wires for transferring files.</p>
<p>Finally, this TV app works as a media center application that is really enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>By the way, to make your Fire TV works correctly, make sure</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your ADB Debugging is enabled (Select “My Fire TV” is Settings and put ADB Debugging “On” in the Developer Options menu)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Stick allows the installation of unknowing services (Choose “Device” and “Developer Options” in Settings, you’ll see “Apps from Unknown Services” in the menu)</li>

<p>Another great choice for Fire TV. The app works as an entire entertainment hub compatible with all the basic devices to enjoy watching video streams.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> Windows PC, Mac, Linux Raspberry Pi, Android 5.0</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $35 per year</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It’s more than just a TV app</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Completely free of advertisement</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Not available in AppStore</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Not perfect UX</li>
</ul>
<p>Among all, Kodi is a media server application. In other words, you can accumulate all types of media content in one place. And if you choose to install some add-ons offered, you can empower your Kodi TV app even more.</p>
<p>As an Android TV app, Kodi helps arrange your media library with an easy-to-follow hierarchy. In particular, it will prescribe categories to your offline files and help with placing them in proper locations. The type of content Kodi works with includes movies, documentaries, music, live TV clips, etc.</p>
<p>To work on Fire TV, it requires sideloading onto another device. That’s why it’s not recommended for people who don’t like working with settings. To install, read a couple of articles in Google on the matter — there’s nothing difficult about learning how to do it, learning how to do it just requires extra time.</p>
<p>Kodi is not compatible with iOS, but you can download several options for remote control from AppStore.</p>

<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen,LG Smart TV</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Free service</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The library has only comedies</li>
</ul>
<p>This year, Pandora has become one of the top 3 picks for the U.S. millennials. And there’s no surprise — the app outperforms Spotify for being free. The functionality of the app allows playing favorite shows on TV, in web browsers, or on the screen of your car.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the video library of the app has only comedy channels. That’s why it deserved a place at the bottom of our list only, no matter how user-friendly the experience offered is. But you can try its comedies — maybe, you’ll like them.</p>

<p>The platform is a digital storefront of movies and TV shows. Users are offered to either purchase a digital license or rent a chosen file for several days. There is no subscription option.</p>

<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Limitless</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> In-app purchases in à la carte menu of movies</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Supports all top TV platforms</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A very limited choice and number of functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Play Movies &amp; TV resembles an old-fashioned shop where you could rent some movies and bring them back. Though sounding rather romantic, this approach is a bit outdated in the contemporary world. It’s much easier (and cheaper) to buy for the service, not for each movie separately.</p>
<p>But the experience is worth a try.</p>
<p>The very idea of Google Play Movies &amp; TV appeared in the competition with iTunes from Apple. In the latest version, the developers added such a heavy compatibility package that the app turned into a complete TV streaming service. However, the software requires lots of other features to become a top pick in the niche.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The business impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on industries across the world is now profound. Leaders and CIOs should rev up their digital business strategies and position themselves for growth when the pandemic subsides. How exactly should leaders manage this impact and get the most out of opportunities? Here’s our answer.</p>

<p>Today, for the global sectors, COVID-19 presents two challenges: largely idled sectors disrupting trade and reduced demand from consumers. A few examples to consider, Chile is reeling from reduced copper demand. Germany — from auto parts shortage.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine how different industries react to business and economic turbulence caused by the novel pandemic through innovation and digital capabilities. We discover this through <b>the example of 8 industries that try to win over the battle using digital and innovation capabilities.</b></p>
<h2 id="healthcare"><b>Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>As each industry emerges from its acute response phase, many will find that they are entering a “new normal.” Expect the way healthcare is practiced and marketed to be no different.</p>
<p>Beyond the negative impact of a traditional economic downturn, COVID-19 presents additional challenges — fear from the virus itself, collective grief, prolonged physical distancing, and associated social isolation — that will compound the impact on our collective <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/helping-us-healthcare-stakeholders-understand-the-human-side-of-the-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19717" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg" alt="stress Covid" width="1200" height="699" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1024x596.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-768x447.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-600x350.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-450x262.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1000x583.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Reported signs of distress related to COVID-19 in the US.</i></p>
<p>As the way healthcare is practiced evolves, so too will the environment and platforms through which that care is delivered. There will be new needs that emerge; new content will be needed, in new formats, manifesting in new marketing assets.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Healthcare and Other Solutions</h3>
<p>There are three areas that healthcare marketing leaders should focus on, as the impact on their business and the subsequent need to adapt will be significant:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Telehealth</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/telehealth-53-growing-faster-any-other-place-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acceptance and utilization of telehealth</a> services within the US were already on a sharp incline before the COVID-19 crisis erupted countrywide.  Since then, medical and municipal leaders are leveraging the platform as a tool in combating the spread of COVID-19, accelerating adoption in the process.</p>
<p>From a Payer perspective, CVS Health, Aetna, Cigna, and United Health are just a few of the payer organizations recommending patients move to virtual care – going so far as to waive copays for utilizing the service.</p>
<p>Consumers are showing increased interest as well, with <a href="https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/disaster-zone/what-are-people-searching-for-on-the-web--relating-to-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEMRush reporting</a> a 146.15% increase in searches for “in-home doctor visits” and a 53.97% increase in “in-home medical care” searches.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Urgent care</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Urgent Care Centers are quickly becoming the front door in a person’s treatment journey.  A study from the Urgent Care Association found that a median of<a href="https://www.ucaoa.org/About-UCA/Industry-News/ArtMID/10309/ArticleID/877/Booming-Urgent-Care-Industry-Filling-the-Gaps-in-Patient-Care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 35% of patients utilizing UCCs</a> do not have primary care physicians, reflecting the fact that Healthcare is shifting to much more of an on-demand service. Medicare and Medicaid patients made up almost 27% of UCC patients in 2018, confirming that the shift is not driven only by the young or affluent.</p>
<p>The organization is flanking the physical services with digital efforts, with  <a href="https://cvshealth.com/thought-leadership/cvs-health-names-more-us-cities-for-healthhub-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost 30% of the landing pages</a> on CVS.com Minute Clinic specific. Not to be outdone, Walmart<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/business/walmart-health-care-clinics-amazon-cvs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> launched the first of its augmented health facilities</a> in September 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Almost everything goes online</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Medical conferences and congresses are a huge priority for companies in the Health sector. These events are valued by commercial organizations, advocacy groups, and healthcare professionals as key opportunities for medical education, peer-to-peer engagement, and the release of official study data.</p>
<p>While some of those activities have been digitally distributed in parallel, a vast majority of that activity is face-to-face. The COVID-19 crisis is forcing digital transformation in healthcare industry to take new turns.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1476f2;"><a style="color: #1476f2;" href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/healthcare"><b>Devmind Healthcare Solutions</b></a></span></h2>
<p>Since healthcare and economic environments force medical experts to take extra shifts, this greatly affects their own quality and safety of life.</p>
<p>The idea behind Devmind’s solution was to empower medical professionals with a simple tool that gives them flexibility, control, and more. We created an <b>on-demand healthcare staffing solution</b> consisting of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">iOS and Android app with an Uber-like feel (for the Nurse role);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web Admin Panel (for Hospital Administrator or Security Supervisor role).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most significant features included there are a nurse and hospital management, shift management, notification center, data export, etc. Solutions of this kind can be a major stride within the current time frames because they help doctors stay focused on more essential things and certain patients with reaching for treatments.</p>
<p>As consumers and organizations have no other choice, the COVID-19 crisis is accelerating the utilization of digital platforms. While there have been financial, behavioral, and attitudinal<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2019185_telehealth_usage_and_awareness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> roadblocks</a> to adoption in the past, the need to overcome the crisis is superseding those roadblocks and increases the number of first-time users.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment"><b>E-commerce and Online Shopping</b></h2>
<p>Today, as B2B digital transformation statistics say, online shopping is the fastest-growing slice of the pie, dominating the scene and continuing to invest in digital capabilities.</p>
<p>Traditional, smaller players are also eyeing the online scene. Many traditional small markets have taken to online channels to hawk products, conduct online auctions, and even to carry out customer relation-building, for example, passing tips on how to prepare dishes using their products.</p>
<p>However, most authorities are warning organizations <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/interviews/coronavirus-spread-preparing-for-the-long-haul-i-4609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to prepare for the long haul</a>. Virtually every company involved in global trade feels the impact.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in B2B E-commerce</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Digitalization had swiftly come into B2B E-commerce sectors a long time ago. But since recent times the situation has drastically changed, the technologies and trends have changed too. Although some things remain untouchable. Still, most of the E-commerce sales are made through mobile devices (</span><a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/806336/mobile-retail-commerce-share-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">73%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">). Progressive Web App (PWA), with its native-app-like experience, is also here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Artificial intelligence, machine learning, personalized customer experience, and predefined analytics — all complement an evolution of B2B consumerization. Data remains the primary fuel for accelerating the development of any organization involved in sales. Focusing on eternal questions: what data to collect and how to process it effectively remains unsolved even today. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19718" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg" alt="social distancing" width="1200" height="1277" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-962x1024.jpg 962w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-768x817.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-600x639.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-423x450.jpg 423w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-940x1000.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In response to social distancing, many businesses will make their E-commerce operations a key priority.</em></p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Here is what we suggest you can do right now to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on your E-commerce business:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Even as early digitalization investments are paying off, the current inability to fulfill delivery of online purchases suggests digitization efforts by businesses have only been focused at the customer-facing end. Supermarket chains should consider integrating their online shopping platforms with the stock-holding information of their physical branches.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 may accelerate the growth of the online grocery sector. People did not just flock to physical supermarkets, but also loaded virtual carts with groceries from online platforms. With government directives to allow workers to work-from-home and to avoid non-essential trips to shopping malls, this trend of online shopping is likely to persist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Another possibility is for online shopping platforms to partner with businesses that specialize in delivery fulfillment such as UberEats, Grab, Glovo, and Bolt Food. B2B digital transformation trends are another milestone companies should consider today.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="entertainment"><b>Entertainment</b></h2>
<p>Around the world, COVID-19 is having a marked impact on media supply, consumption, and advertising. Demand for content-streamed, live, and multi-layered — is skyrocketing while new content creation has been largely turned off.</p>
<p>Since cinema and amusement parks across the globe are all shut down for uncertain times, thousands of entertainment organizations suffer formidable losses and fail to receive any kind of income. The outbreak triggered online entertainment and how some companies are finding ways to engage differently with consumers and the new reality.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19709" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-scaled.jpg" alt="Netflix home" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/closeup-photo-of-person-holding-panasonic-remote-control-in-987586-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for all forms of media — TV programs, short-form video, music streaming, and online gaming, particularly in geographies currently under stay-home instructions, has surged. Digital transformation in entertainment is expecting more new turns in the foreseen future.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The supply of new content may be limited to a few weeks for some formats (e.g., daytime dramas). New TV series currently being launched were completed prior to production sets shutting down.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Network resiliency and capacity continues to be a focus, as the demand for content surges. In the European Union, streaming platforms are reducing video quality to ensure networks are not overwhelmed and that customers can still view content.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">While sports companies come to terms with a wave of cancellations, many are seeking new ways to reach their customers digitally. Many are looking to eSports or online simulated events to provide content to fans, with even professional athletes engaging in eSports competitions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Musicians are going online and relying on streaming platforms as live shows are canceled.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #1476f2;"><a style="color: #1476f2;" href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/music"><b>Devmind Solutions in Entertainment</b></a></span></h2>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fast users growth potential;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Streamlined rich client application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="food"><b>Restaurants and Food delivery</b></h2>
<p>Despite some concerns, food delivery companies gain their momentum and become a popular option as people practice social distancing. It&#8217;s hard to pinpoint exactly how much growth there has been in this sector, but higher demand has led to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-the-coronavirus-spreads-in-Zambia-food-delivery-companies-could-see-a-surge-in-demand-are-they-ready-2020-02-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher pricing</a> in some areas. What more to expect?</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Food Industry</h3>
<p>Uber, for example, recently provided Uber-only drivers with information on adding Uber Eats food deliveries to their services. Within the first week, around <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/increasing-earning-opportunities-with-uber-eats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15% of Uber drivers</a> had completed their first food delivery.</p>
<p>Fine dining establishments, small-town restaurants, and fast foods are now switching to offer delivery services to their customers. At the same time, restaurants that did not previously offer take-outs are now considering this option as never before. Some restaurants choose a third-party delivery service to partner with, and each offer comes with unique benefits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19710" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-scaled.jpg" alt="Uber eats Covid" width="2560" height="2048" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-768x614.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-600x480.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-450x360.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/flat-lay-photography-of-two-tray-of-foods-1640769-1000x800.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>Uber Eats and Deliveroo, among others, have launched contactless “leave at your door service” to help drivers and customers follow social distancing and quarantine rules.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding already in place strict food hygiene <a href="https://trans.info/en/covid-19-pandemic-triggers-surge-in-global-food-delivery-industry-178243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards</a>, consumers may also be interested to learn if the businesses have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">New practices for social distancing in the kitchen or during delivery pickups;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Policy for staff members who display symptoms of COVID-19;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in food delivery guidelines, such as containers that allow for easier disinfection or better customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it is uncertain where the digital transformation in food industry and the delivery trend will go in the post-COVID-19 era, many businesses are working as hard as they can to ensure they meet consumers’ expectations and remain relevant by providing an excellent service.</p>
<h2 id="industry"><b>IT &amp; Tech Industry</b></h2>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 and are having <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/understanding-covid-19-s-impact-on-the-technology-sector-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant impact on the technology sector,</a> too. However, the disruption has caused reevaluation on organizations’ business continuity plans (BCPs) as well as the acceleration of remote operations and online meetings. Let&#8217;s dive in to see what has changed more and what solutions organizations appeal to remain afloat.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in IT and Other Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Companies with remote-working technologies already see increased demand as organizations accelerate their remote-working capabilities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Security software will see third-order benefits from a growing remote workforce. Organizations race to secure endpoints, cloud-based tools, log management, and VPNs. So, IT spending on security software will increase too.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19711" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg" alt="home teacher" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to enhanced remote work scenarios, IT digital transformation will play a larger role in future BCPs. Thus, CIOs and senior management will need to ensure a resilient, secure network, disaster recovery systems, and more devices for the ones working remotely.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for ever-faster access to data and automation will drive the focus on network equipment and communications, speeding up 5G network and equipment introduction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increase in the use of tele- and video-conferencing software as more companies encourage employees to commute.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="construction"><b>Construction</b></h2>
<p>Today, the most vulnerable industries are those lacking digitalization and tech maturity. The construction industry is one of them.</p>
<p>Creating $1.3 trillion worth of structures each year only in the USA, the construction industry remains one of the most under-digitized industrial sectors. Longer-term construction companies <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-s-impact-on-industrial-products---construction-firms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">across the globe</a> will have to contend with decreased demand as governments face rising deficits, and residential and commercial projects are dampened by unemployment and low GDP growth.</p>
<p>To stay one step ahead of the crisis, the sector requires a different approach to the overall strategy. Digital transformation in construction industry is a burning topic for both — senior management and government. What are the solutions construction companies have today?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Today, key questions executives and boards should be asking are: do we need to rethink our company’s digital strategy to remain financially solvent, and how can we use technology to gain operational leverage. And the digital transformation in the construction industry becomes inevitable.</p>

<h2 id="hospitality"><b>Hospitality</b></h2>
<p>Hospitality is taking proactive financial steps to mitigate the huge impact. It’s obvious today, both revenue and supply chains will be affected the most. Hotels, restaurants, theme parks, cinemas all went silent. The entire disruptive effect of the hospitality industry will have a significant, tremendous impact on the global hospitality industry and economy. And there is a question hangs heavy in the air — can digital transformation in hospitality industry change the rule of the game?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Despite this, hospitality shows its maturity level: in working together, showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can. Technologies like artificial intelligence, big data, connected devices, virtual and augmented realities are shaping the hospitality industry as we speak.</p>

<p>Only during the last two decades dozens of industry disruptors, such as Airbnb, Skyscanner, and TripAdvisor, have appeared on the market. Companies and organizations are expected to get out of the crisis more digitally mature, and those ones who find enough strength to focus on digitalization — are going to win the race. Here are some of the steps to consider today:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“We may be apart, but we&#8217;ll get through this together,” <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1538581578_Ju69Wm%2FOxIW8lBSY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Airbnb experts</a> introducing 50 new online experiences with unique activities for their customers. The home-sharing platform curates free online experiences to inspire people and stay afloat.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Digital transformation in the hospitality industry should now be focused on those that we know are available to travel. The dramatic rise in online gambling during COVID-19 lockdowns is one of the results of current circumstances. The online gambling industry is one of the winners of the current shutdown, and some offline casinos and other organizations can consider this as a potential opportunity for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Smart automation confidently moved into the industry through the Internet of Things technology. It has improved not only the convenience and comfort standards for clients but also reduced costs for businesses and organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Robots that handle food preparation and delivery, predictive analytics, and cloud storage — are the next big moves for automation in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the COVID-19 shutdown has brought the industry to a standstill, it is also an opportunity for the companies to reevaluate their digital strategies and map out the right path ahead.</p>

Digital transformation in FinTech triggers a “Big Pocket” battle between incumbents and challengers to win the (newly) online customer. Financial Institutions turn to Tech companies rather than in-house solutions to accelerate digital transformation.</p>

<h2 id="sensing">Sensing and Shaping the Post-COVID Era</h2>
<p>Crisis often leads to changes. This time is no exception. The shifts in social attitudes and behaviors we see today pave the broad path to new opportunities and ways of living and working. Some of which is here to stay with us in the long run. Some of which disappear right after the crisis is gone.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some changes show a positive dynamic. For example, we see a greater focus on crisis preparedness, system resilience, social inequality, social solidarity, and access to health care. These attitudinal shifts could, in turn, be reflected in significant policy shifts in many areas, including trade, border controls, health care, crisis preparedness, foreign affairs, employment, and social welfare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we are facing a worldwide lockdown that keeps us home. Although the situation is overwhelming and causes a lot of difficulties, the best we can do is to stay home and make the best of it.</p>
<p>We find ourselves limited to our homes, but still, we can look on the bright side. For instance, work from home requires spending at least eight hours a day in front of the laptop, but we save at least two hours every day as there is no need to commute to the office. This extra time gives us a chance to spend some quality time with our family as well as devote it to personal growth and development. Take care of your body and mind by taking up physical exercises.</p>
<p>Apart from being good for our body, sports activities also help to keep peace of mind. It will distract you from disturbing thoughts and make you feel better during the quarantine. Despite unfortunate reasons, it’s a great opportunity to <strong>challenge yourself, make your body look better, or maintain your regular routine before lockdown</strong>. Luckily, nowadays, we even don’t need to go to the gym to stay fit, thanks to mobile apps.</p>
<p>The statistic shows that the number of downloads of fitness apps has risen within the past few weeks. More people now have a chance to do things they’ve always postponed due to the lack of time or other reasons we come up with just not to exercise.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the right mobile application, we have researched on this topic and came up with the list of the best fitness apps for iOS and Android. The applications have a number of features that won’t require additional instructions from the coach, as you can have it all online. Living in the era of advanced technologies makes it possible to get through the difficult times easier and adds some entertainment to our daily routine. Go through the list and find the most suitable app for regular training.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the full impact of a novel pandemic is still unknown, many organizations are being impacted by the crisis domino effect, which reflects on employees, assets, operations, stakeholders, and even reputation.</p>
<p>Being proactive during disruption means that companies need to consider their business continuity preparedness activities and profound crisis management. This article is focused on risk identification and organizational exposure, on critical dependencies, and how to act pragmatically and effectively during crises and find resilience solutions.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Destructive behavioral models: before implementing any IT crisis management approach, make sure you choose the most reasonable scenario to act.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">IT crisis management examples in theory and in practice.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Test and tried IT crisis management strategies and how to activate them in order to survive on the market.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Crisis management in IT project: Dangerous behavioral models</h2>
<p>Humans manage IT businesses, so managers are likely to choose natural reactions in crisis. And this is dangerous! Such subconscious sweet escapes lead to controversial consequences to the companies. So, before trying any IT crisis management approach, ensure your behavior is not destructive first.</p>
<p>Psychologists distinguish three natural reactions to stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fight,</li>
<li>Flight, or</li>
<li>Freeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these behaviors are not rational but instinct-based. Thus, they significantly complicate your ability to succeed in crisis management in IT projects. But there is some good news: once acknowledged, you can neutralize them.</p>
<p>So, check yourself by completing our quick test.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19468" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6.png" alt="fight freeze" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>1. A person who fights in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You check the news and see what this world is coming to. Oil, financial crisis, coronavirus, worldwide quarantine, etc. This uncontrollable destruction makes you furious.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your common reaction to stress is arguing and rejecting the severity of the problem. You’re likely to think, “This coronavirus is just the flu. I prefer to disregard, close my eyes, and keep on working as usual.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you keep setting ambitious business aims, negotiating new strategies, and publishing aggressive ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve recognized yourself in this type of personality, calm down first. Everything will be back soon, but you need to act accordingly. We&#8217;re all victims of the circumstances here. In a crisis, we need to be even more flexible as usual. Don&#8217;t be stubborn, or the world will crush you down.</p>
<h3>2. A person who flight in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Once you face danger, you feel the urge to disappear. If the problems are increasing like a snow avalanche, you lose control over the situation. The severity of a crisis frightens you.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In a stressful situation, you want to close your eyes, run away from the city, and disappear with your family (or alone).</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you feel the urge to quit all the operational processes and cut all the costs. This may sound reasonable. But once uncontrolled, this behavior turns into destruction. And your team can find a strong reason to call you a deceiver.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re an escapist, realize that’s your unconscious behavior. Next time you feel the urge to run, just pause and take a deep breath. Remember: in crisis, your company needs a new strategy, and your team needs a real leader. If you choose to run away, you sign the death of your business.</p>
<h3>3. A person who freezes in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In any uncontrollable situation, you can’t decide how to react. You feel paralyzed and literally freeze in one place.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t act until you see what the next move the majority takes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you prefer to change nothing and see what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among these three instinctive reactions, freezing is the most reasonable scenario in shock. You don’t keep setting high aims in inappropriate circumstances. You&#8217;re not the one who closes everything and gives up without fighting. But you’re destroying your business if you literally sit and do nothing.</p>
<p>Whichever your natural reaction is, keep going slowly. And think of restructuring the business according to the new rules. It’s a high time to think of new opportunities, time-honored outsourcing strategies, and your life after the crisis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19469" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8.png" alt="life after crisis" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>4. I’m not fighting, running, or freezing. What’s my IT crisis management plan?</h3>
<p>Once you become aware of your instincts and ready to do a careful analysis, don’t expect to get a ready-to-use recipe from any article. When it comes to crisis management, any decision is tailor-made. Still, there are some common sense IT crisis management practices that work both in crisis and stable time. In this harsh reality, it’s time to remind them.</p>
<p>Remember the test above: the biggest mistake is to make any sudden movements. All your crisis decisions are contextual. Their magic power will end once people come back to the streets, and the world economy recovers. Of course, you can gain some profit by catching the moment today &#8211; but you will need to reinvent something in the long run. If you want to invest today in the future, think of the proper policies, technologies, and cost optimization approaches.</p>
<h2>Crisis management examples: Theory and Practice</h2>
<p>You can come back to books, searching for previously developed scenarios of how to act in today’s crisis. But they won’t help you. Nobody predicted the unique combination of all current troubles before &#8211; health threat because of coronavirus, social threat because of quarantine, and economic threat because of the financial crisis. You can collect the pieces of useful information in books, but nobody can tell you what to do exactly.</p>
<p>In its turn, the contemporary business practice has already shown one reliable truth: when all the expenses are rearranged, there’s one category that isn’t cut at any cost. This is digitalization, the constant driver for the innovations. When everybody is self-isolated, the Internet is the only communication channel left. And the demand for greater digitalization can be put at the core of IT crisis management strategic recovery for 2020.</p>

<h3>Digitalization is a form of cooperation that can both save an offline company in these hard times and become a center of IT crisis management strategy.</h3>
<p>Once forced to become remote or die, the businesses will try their best to cover the lack of digital tools. To survive, many managers stop useless spending and turn to investing in their added business value. And here, IT companies become extremely helpful to them. Software is a solution for various offline operations needed today. The remote developers can create a fast and efficient delivery for coffee shops, implement an app for outfits from showrooms or orchestrate the remote working process for an office team. IT can manage the crisis by covering the basic demand for digitalization under the new market rules, in short.</p>
<p>With a proper mindset, a crisis is always an opportunity. But don’t be in a rush to catch any of them while in crisis.</p>
<h3>Think of cost optimization, not cost-cutting</h3>
<p>To survive and become great again, check if you’re ready for three IT directions on which future pivots:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on remote workplace optimization and dedicated development team creation,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting various forms of business process outsourcing &#8211; a traditional software development outsourcing company or its alternative forms: offshore software development, nearshore software development, or an outstaffing company,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing shared services and establishing effective collaboration models.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these models have been effective and highly recommended for all the companies during the last couple of years. But today, they are likely to help you stand this storm and become stronger after the crisis.</p>
<p>They work if only you had started adopting them before coronavirus conquered the world, of course.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19471" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8.png" alt="action course" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Remote workplace and dedicated development teams</h3>
<p>People all over the world stay home, but the majority of them keep working remotely. For years, remote developers have been hippies &#8211; but during quarantine, managers see the true value of a dedicated development team. The current situation is an opportunity for IT companies to organize micromanagement processes more effectively and build a team of highly motivated and talented people who can stand any crisis.</p>
<h3>Software development outsourcing company or the power of new collaboration models</h3>
<p>Introducing outsourcing software development is an effective strategy both in crisis and long after it passes. By finding a proper balance between in-house activities and outsourced operations, the cost optimization approach shows its best.</p>
<h3>Requesting offshore software development services (or how to optimize your expenses with offshore software development cost)</h3>
<p>Offshore model is among the real solutions to cost optimization during this crisis. This way, an offshore software development company can effectively reduce expenses for keeping an in-house team. Also, it allows fast hiring and fast scaling, which ensures the needed flexibility during the crisis.</p>
<h3>Nearshore software development model and IT outstaffing</h3>
<p>When you work remotely, the exact form of cooperation and the geographical location of your developers doesn’t matter that much. Additionally, you don’t need a separate budget to maintain an office. These models ensure high flexibility: they are project-based, provide managed services, and enable fast time-to-market delivery during the quarantine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19472" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6.png" alt="delivery chain" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Crisis management steps: Two strategic moves that will help you survive</h3>
<p>Let’s deal with it: you cannot change anything dramatically in the current situation. The best to do is to freeze and think of optimizing your costs. In the end, the 2020 crisis is nothing but a mistake to live through.</p>
<p>While steadily dealing with it, aim at reaching these two strategic goals:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your portfolio. Never depend on one product or project. Never rely on offline only, be ready to switch to another business development direction once needed. Prepare yourself for the worst scenario, and this will save your nerves and income figures.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Always have a rainy day fund. Your employees can live without extra entertainment in stable times &#8211; but in crisis, they will be happy to receive their salaries on time and not being fired.</li>
</ol>
<p>These strategies should be constant and gain different appearances in various IT processes. For example, you can teach your team the basics of remote productivity in stable times &#8211; and your remote developers will leave the next crisis more united than all in-house workers after quarantine. Cooperating with an outstaffing company in advance will teach your business to work with external collaborators and save your money for keeping in-house talents.</p>
<p>Remain constant in digitalization, no matter what tomorrow brings. Your digital workplace lives here.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19473" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4.png" alt="digital workplace" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>How two crisis management strategies will help you succeed in the future: The secret ingredient and the final thought</h3>
<p>Once you learn from today’s bitter experience, you are ready for future crises. But any tactical and strategic step won’t work without the proper background. The fundamental trait is the strength of your IT brand.</p>
<p>Your clients should love you and be ready to help once you need it. Invest in this, and enjoy the magic of their support.</p>
<p>Keep calm, optimize your costs, and be valuable by yourself. This way, you will survive any crisis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coronavirus highlights the need to transform traditional retail industry <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/consumer-deloitte-ccfa-survey-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approaches</a> to doing business. Especially when the “world’s factory”, China, is itself spiraling in the confusing and complex global reaction. COVID-19 forces the retail industry to rethink and transform their models digitally. And the real question is, how exactly should it respond to immediate change?</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retailers are going to overthink how they use technologies to find new ways <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/robert-hetu/covid-19-resources-for-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to get revenue</a> and build up innovative business models amid pandemic.</li>
<li>Retail digital transformation has already started in some ways, and some companies already get some advantages from the changes they have made.</li>
<li>Right now, fulfillment and last-mile execution, transparency, workforce, and pricing — are four key areas COVID-19 hit the most. This is where retail CIOs must focus their attention and bring the full capacity of digitalization.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What is Digital Transformation in Retail? Inevitable Changes of the Future</h2>
<p>Digital transformation is penetrating into every sphere and industry we know today, starting with finance, banking, mass media, education, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. <strong>Companies go digital <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19--impact-on-food---beverage-consumer-products-companies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to enhance</a> their services and offered facilities</strong> in order to bring up the level of satisfaction of their customers. The whole idea behind it is based on the customers’ needs and involves other aspects like process organization within the company, its employees, external communication, and technologies used.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19408" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-scaled.jpg" alt="What is Digital Transformation in Retail" width="2560" height="1691" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-768x507.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-1536x1015.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-2048x1353.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-600x396.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-450x297.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-1000x661.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>The same goes for digital transformation in retail. Retailers are going to overthink how they use technologies to find new ways to get revenue and build up innovative business models. It follows that as <strong>technologies and digital tools evolve</strong>, they are going to have a great influence not only on the services provided by the company, but also its inner culture, management, organization of the workflow.</p>
<p>In addition to this, it gives employees a number of opportunities, as they master new skills and obtain valuable knowledge. Overall, it’s a long-term process (life-circle) where one change leads to another and influences other components involved in the digital transformation process.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation in Retail: Benefits</h2>
<p>The process of retail digital transformation is not an easy one, as for the other industries. But if you have a well-thought strategy in your hands and clearly see the results you aim for, then it’s worth putting your foot on this path, as digital transformation comes not only with challenges but brings a number of advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier Connection</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Digital transformation makes it easier for retailers and their customers to connect and communicate via social media accounts, websites, chatbots, mobile apps, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smoother Operations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of Cloud technologies will improve operations within the company as the external ones, reduce the time spent on sharing information with the customers, thus improving client support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More Convenient</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, now customers can shop without cashiers. AI automation of some processes will enhance the customer experience. Also, it enables retailers to sell their products not only in physical stores but via websites or mobile apps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Revenue</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Digital transformation is retail that enables providers to have more than one channel of income, thus gives a chance to reach a wider target audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better Customer Experience</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All the changes that come with digital transformation influence customer experience and make it better. Technical tools facilitate the work of the employees, make services quicker and more efficient, thus customers get high-quality services, their journey of buying products becomes a more pleasant one, etc. As the whole concept of digital transformation is customer-centered, they get the most but help your business become better and prosper.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation in Retail Banking</h2>
<p>Retail digital transformation also takes place in banking, as it is a part of the industry. Retail banks should take advantage of the customer data they get. It is especially important for their digital transformation journey, as it was already said, <strong>the process is customer-centered.</strong> The data that banks have access to can be used as a base for innovation and solutions that can enhance customer experience, make it more personalized.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19409" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1.jpg" alt="Digital Transformation in Retail Banking" width="1206" height="834" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1.jpg 1206w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1-1024x708.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1-768x531.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1-600x415.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1-450x311.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-1-1000x692.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1206px) 100vw, 1206px" /></p>
<p>Tools like IoT, AI, Blockchain, etc. help to analyze data in a sufficient way, automate some of the processes, as well as reduce the number of paperwork. For instance, thanks to online banking, people now don’t have to line up at the bank office to get answers to their issues or provide payments. In addition to this, technical tools make services more easy-to-use, thus improve customer experience and attract new customers.</p>
<p><strong>In order to succeed and survive the competition</strong> with other retail banks or platforms that provide similar services, banks should take into consideration the security issue. Security is of a high priority as customers trust with their money and want their funds to be safe. Online banking requires high-quality tools to protect data, and thanks to digital technologies we have today, it’s possible.</p>
<h2>Retail Digital Transformation Trends for Post-COVID-19 Times</h2>
<p>Retail digital transformation has already started in some ways, and some companies already get some advantages from the changes they have made. Still, as we know the process of digital transformation is not a short-term thing, as we have a constant change of the technologies, innovative solutions occur regularly, and in order to keep up a track of the latest trends, we have come up with the list of top ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Applications</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A mobile app is <strong>a great connector between customer and retailer’s physical shop.</strong> Customers can check on the products, watch and read reviews, etc. In addition to this, they can easily contact the support group in case of inquiries.</p>
<p>If you still do not have a mobile application for the store, you should consider this option, as it has a great number of advantages, facilitates purchasing, and brings you closer to your customers. Also, mobile apps are a good start for further development, as it is possible to add new features and enhance the services you provide.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>AR in the digital transformation of the services is a great tool that allows customers <strong>to try and view things without leaving their homes.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, IKEA came up with an awesome idea of letting its customers choose the best pieces of furniture by using their app. You just have to point a camera to the right place at home, and the app will offer you options that suit your interior. Another example is Toyota, where you can try different cars before making any decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual Reality technology has great potential for the retail industry to develop and grow. This tech solution will definitely <strong>enhance customer experience</strong>, as they will be able to check cars, homes, etc. without even stepping inside of it.</p>
<h2>Retail Digital Transformation Challenges: Managing risk and disruption</h2>
<p>Digital transformation contains one more meaning behind this term, it’s — to <strong>be adaptive to the changes</strong>. It’s not a static process, so you cannot 100% predict further steps.</p>
<p>But the company can have a thoroughly detailed strategy that will help them to keep up on the path to digital transformation. Retailers should find ways to satisfy the needs of customers who have different preferences and expectations. It follows that businesses should learn to be agile and flexible. This is not only about customers, but the inner-company organization of the processes, communication between employees, departments, and customers, etc.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19410" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-scaled.jpg" alt="Retail Digital Transformation Market" width="2560" height="1441" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Retail-Digital-Transformation-Market-1000x563.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>Another challenge will be to figure out <strong>which technologies should be used</strong> to turn your ideas into reality. The company should have professional IT specialists at their service who can consult, give their expert opinion, and complete projects within stated time frames. It’s possible to hire individual professionals with your own efforts, but also you can use outsourcing.</p>
<p>Also, retailers might face challenges with <strong>data analysis.</strong> There are numerous channels that help them get information about customers, but this data should be properly analyzed. Luckily, nowadays, there is access to numerous tools that can be of great help in this matter as personal data gives you a chance to learn more about your customers thus giving you a chance to provide more personalized offers and enhance their experience with your services and products.</p>
<h2>Retail Digital Transformation Market: Going Digital</h2>
<p>The process of digital transformation has already started and has an enormous influence on the retail market. New channels of revenue and deep data analysis thanks to the technologies we have today, make it possible for the industry to grow. For now, we know for sure that the process won’t stop, and we will see a major boost in the retail market thanks to digital tools and technologies.</p>
<p>The only thing to do is to set up a strategy and work towards your goals in order to enhance customer’s experience, optimize the inner-company processes, make shopping easier, and more fun. Nowadays, we have everything to make it happen.</p>
<h2>COVID-19: Helping Retail Conquer Digital Transformation</h2>
<p>Depending on the countries, categories, and customers’ mixes, the impact of the novel coronavirus is very different for every retailer. Right now, fulfillment and last-mile execution, transparency, workforce, and pricing — are four <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/consumer-deloitte-ccfa-survey-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key areas</a> COVID-19 hit the most. This is where retail CIOs must focus their attention and bring the full capacity of digitalization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The profound humanitarian fallout of the COVID-19 continues to expand by the day. Governments have launched unprecedented public-health and economic responses. Companies have developed and implemented business continuity plans, security guidance, and, most importantly — seamless remote working conditions. In this article, we offer some of Devmind’s latest insights of managing a team of remote developers during times like this.</p>
<h1><b>How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h1>
<p>So here we are, living in a world where pandemic movies came to life. The number of ill people is rising, as well as the level of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Since March 16, our employees have been working remotely. We have already faced all the possible difficulties on our way and learned how to tackle the main challenges to manage the working process smart and effectively. We are ready to spill the beans and share all the secrets of productive remote management.</p>
<p>To stop COVID-19, all the countries around the world are trying to minimize human interactions, resulting in <strong>a staggering number of employees learning how to work remotely</strong>. Even though the majority of software engineers are not new to work like this, it can still be quite a challenge to manage a team in such difficult times psychologically.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19392 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg" alt="How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>That is why in this article, we are going to shed light on ten tips to organize an effective working process with remote developers, taking into account both psychological pitfalls and practical hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><b>How to Manage a Team of Remote Developers Despite the Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to outline all the possible challenges your software development team may face when working from home. Usually, it boils down to three main challenges. These are communication problems and pitfalls, lack of well-functioned equipment, and the inability to manage productivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, before setting out the rules, guidelines, and software development team goals, make sure you did your best to eliminate or alleviate the possible struggles that may occur.</p>
<h2><b>10 Tips To Keep Your Developers Team Effective During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h2>
<p>Luckily, we have already examined the best cases of smart and efficient remote developers management and prepared a quick guide for you to follow. We have taken into consideration the main challenges that can be difficult to tackle and offering comprehensive solutions to the problem. Take a look and enjoy the tips that truly work.</p>
<h3><b>1. Secure a Well-Functioned Tech Facilities and Tools</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need some software that will unite all the working processes. To ensure productivity, you’d better have a look at <strong>various collaboration tools perfect for a software development team working remotely.</strong>  Such tools as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/ru/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=77960797405&amp;campaign=1495118561&amp;creative=389415003358&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p48956357108&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1u6J2htFRXh6wNFyzNse_aL_oTmPCvKEjPuVZYAT10fuV645yZsumIaAieOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> enable us to stay focused on daily tasks, plan and manage projects. Slack helps our team to stay connected all the time. It’s the place where we <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-team-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainstorm</a> and solve current issues. And Zoom, as a perfect alternative to Skype, is a way more convenient tool to have video calls and screen sharing.</p>
<p>What is more, there are tons of <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/tools-for-remote-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity tools</a> that are both efficient and have friendly interfaces like Todoist, iDoneThis, and Atlassian Stash. With the help of such systems, it is much easier to have an overall picture needed when working remotely.</p>
<h3><b>2. Make Sure Your Staff Have Everything for Effective Work</b></h3>
<p>But for the obvious essentials like a well-function computer or a laptop and great Internet connection, one should think through all the possible hurdles on the way to a smooth remote working process. Ensure that you have <strong>a backup to the cloud in case there is any accidental deletion of valuable files. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, your workers need to have “<a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/secure-collaboration-remote-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a> to servers, development environments, and shared code.” Otherwise, your software developers teams will just stumble upon inconveniences that could lower their productivity.</p>
<h3><b>3. Think Through Communication Channels</b></h3>
<p>Even though many people hate these real face-to-face meetings, during such gatherings, you can communicate fast, transmit your ideas fast, and, most importantly, solve the existing problems fast. When working with remote developers, it is vital to have <strong>regular video meetings.</strong> Not only will regular conferences reduce the problem with the lack of information, but they also help to unite workers and show they are all in this together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19388 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg" alt="Think Through Communication Channels During Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><b>4. Help Your Workers With Self-Organization</b></h3>
<p>If you want your developers’ team to be productive, you need to show them the importance of <strong>self-organization and discipline</strong>. Teach them to stay online during the working day. What is more, be a great example and don’t bother them with work issues at weekends and when the working day has ended.</p>
<p>Explain that the remote work schedule is no different from work in the office, and this is actually the good news. The reason is simple: you work the same amount of time, but you don’t waste your time commuting, for instance. What is more, psychologically it is less stressful when you do your job within the agreed time period, having no put offs, and then just relax after the work is done.</p>
<h3><b>5. Set Software Development Team Roles and Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>Make sure both formal and informal roles are distributed effectively so that each employee knows exactly what their responsibilities are. When working remotely, a team <strong>“can truly benefit from having informal roles like various kinds of leaders, idea generators, critics, and doers”</strong>, as it is the key to self-management.</p>
<p>Plus, it is worth mentioning that to maximize productivity, you’d better build small teams of <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-8 people</a>. Such teams are more autonomous, take responsibility for their initiatives, and as a result, are more efficient. In case you’re developing a big project, you can always divide one team into sub-teams.</p>
<h3><b>6. Keep Everyone Updated</b></h3>
<p>When working together on one project, it is crucial that <strong>all the members are in the loop</strong>, especially in the case of remote developers. For this reason, once again, think through regular conference meetings to discuss the relevant issues. Knowing the status of other projects, or being aware of any changes in the company’s goals and objectives is all crucial to an employee working remotely. That is why ensure that nobody is missing out on anything.</p>
<h3><b>7. Encourage Open Conversation </b></h3>
<p>Let us face reality, COVID-19 is not the usual flu, and it has been a long time since the last serious pandemic. That is why all the people are feeling stressed, anxious, and some can even get depressed. An employer or HR manager encourages open conversation with your workers. Make sure you ask your workers how they feel.</p>
<p><strong>“It is <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/7-tips-for-working-fsuccessfully-managing-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed</a> that the main struggle remote workers face is the feeling of loneliness and isolation”.</strong> For this reason, it would be a great idea to offer an opportunity for an online session with the psychologist. After all, you are working with people, and their emotional and physical being is the main priority.</p>
<h3><b>8. Remind About Data Protection</b></h3>
<p>Ensure that your employees are informed about protecting data. Remind them that it isn’t advisable to transfer work data, materials, and emails to their personal devices without permission. In case they do not have any other choice but to work on their personal laptop or computer, make sure that they <strong>take all the necessary precautions</strong> like antivirus software or not letting the browsers save some work passwords, for instance.</p>
<p>What is more, you should ensure <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/software-teams/how-to-keep-your-remote-software-development-team-safe-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure connections</a> with VPN, as well as adopt smart and secure cloud storage solutions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19391 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-scaled.jpg" alt="Remind About Data Protection During Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/grayscale-photo-of-woman-wearing-eyeglasses-1181655-1000x668.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><b>9. Trust Your Developers Team</b></h3>
<p>If you want to create a comfortable and efficient working environment, it is not about tracking and monitoring productivity all the time or comparing the performance. <strong>It is about believing in your team</strong>, talking to them, and taking an interest in what bothers them. After all, it does not matter whether you work from home or stay in the office. If a team achieves the required outcome, it means they are doing a great job.</p>
<h3><b>10. Goals Are the Priority, Not Activity</b></h3>
<p>According to Forbes contributor Donal Hatter, who specializes in sales and effective leadership, <strong>it is crucial to focus on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/30/top-15-tips-to-effectively-manage-remote-employees/#62a35f47503c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objectives</a> when working with a remote team.</strong> He believes that productivity boils down to the results having been achieved, rather than what is being done. For this reason, the last tip is to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your team and work towards them no matter the obstacles.</p>
<h1><b>How to Motivate and Manage Remote Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis </b></h1>
<p>Believe it or not, humanity has always been facing this or that crisis. However, the main advantage of the human race is the ability to adapt to any kind of change or environment. That is why getting used to working remotely is also just a matter of time and, in fact, is the future of work.</p>
<p>Embrace such an opportunity to build strong functionality even when your employees are not under control in the office. Be there for them, be consistent, and set clear goals. Use all the abundance of online tools to do work as productive as offline, or even better as <a href="https://www.inc.com/stephen-denny/3-ways-to-inspire-innovation-from-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working remotely</a> today may be the key to innovation tomorrow.</p>
