										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 23, Devmind’s top experts of the Construction Industry went live for a 40-minute webinar to discuss how construction leaders should act now to think one step ahead of the current crisis.</p>
<p>Our experts weigh in on the latest research and trends to help to imagine the perfect digitization phases for one building development and more effective, affordable, and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>The “Digital Transformation in Construction. Thinking One Step Ahead” tackled the areas of implementation, real-life examples, constraints, and more regarding the potential digital transformation steps as different layers or dimensions of the BIM repository and other essential tools.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Watch The Video:</b></a></h2>
<p><iframe title="Webinar: Digital Transformation in Construction" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a65aj-SD0FA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Digitalization as XD Roadmap</h2>
<p>Digital transformation in the construction industry is not just a nice to have thing from a design, estimating, and safety perspective. It is also becoming a part of state regulations in most developed countries.</p>
<p>During the webinar, we considered the adoption of 3D and CAD modeling as the base-level and reviewed all other D’s to 8D as a new layer or dimension added new Interactions between parties, collaboration opportunities, and other benefits.</p>
<p>Talking about the ecosystem, there were five parties of system interactions: customers who would be a project owner, a cost control department, management including Project and Operations managers, third-party vendors and contractors, and engineers and developers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19912" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg" alt="webinar roadmap " width="1563" height="1177" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg 1563w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-768x578.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-600x452.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-450x339.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1000x753.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1563px) 100vw, 1563px" /></p>
<p>In the 3D case, our base level, we assumed that all designing and engineering work is done in 3D. So all initial project documentation right from the start is digital. We have Architects and Engineers collaborating and sharing on the system. The 4th dimension or 4D case would be time.</p>
<p>In the particular version the BIM repository adds:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Planning and Estimation;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration with construction management tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Documents, Materials, and Phases approvals workflows;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Deep integration with Design and construction simulation tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the 5th dimension, we would add costs. In the 6th layer, we add even more parties and control to the system. The 7th dimension is all about post-production management, operations, and reconstruction. And finally, the last 8th dimension is safety during the project and after it is completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch Webinar</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How many top-rated TV apps do you really know?</h2>
<p>Indeed, how many? The majority knows Netflix and YouTube. Some others will recall Amazon and Disney, probably. But only a couple of people realize there are at least 15 excellent TV apps you can enjoy this season.</p>
<p>When you stay home and have plenty of free time because of COVID-19, the most obvious lifestyle is to lay on a couch, watch movies or TV series, and wait until this disaster is over. You are likely to get bored with this pretty fast.</p>
<p>And if this quarantine has shown any clear thing about Netflix, it is that this streaming service is not perfect. YouTube is also an unreliable partner — especially after the news that the streaming quality of this service is lower than usual now.</p>
<p>That’s why we want you to know more TV apps. Don’t put up with low quality and limited choice from the most famous TV streaming apps. Shift your gaze to all the 15 representatives in our list of top TV apps this year. Definitely, you’ll find something new and interesting here.</p>
<h2>The list of top TV apps</h2>
<p>According to our research, the rating of top TV apps for 2020 has the following appearance:</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="#pandora">Pandora</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="#google">Google Play Movies &amp; TV</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s investigate them all!</p>
<h2>The leader of top Apple TV apps</h2>
<h3 id="netflix">#1 Netflix</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19836 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11.png" alt="Netflix TV apps" width="1310" height="681" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11.png 1310w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-300x156.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-1024x532.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-768x399.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-600x312.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-450x234.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image11-1000x520.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" /></p>
<p>Netflix is the leader in the streaming industry. It rocks not only the rating of TV apps but also the list of top apps for Apple TV (leaving far behind Apple TV Plus, for example). If you want to enjoy high-quality video content, subscribe to Netflix.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Up to 6 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $8.99 per month (Basic), $12.99 per month (Standard), $15.99 per month (Premium)</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list: </b></p>
<p>+ Supports all the top platforms</p>
<p>+ The breathtaking collection of Netflix originals</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Paid subscription only</li>
</ul>
<p>According to TCL, the leading streamer in the USA, Netflix is the most used TV app in the country (not a surprise). Of course, Netflix is cool, and you don’t need this guide to learn its value. At the same time, there’s still some room for improvement.</p>
<p>Netflix has premium status in the world of TV apps, so you must pass the procedure of signing in and paying to watch the videos. Not everybody likes it.</p>
<p>Netflix library cannot cover all the videos you might be interested in. Even though it offers over 100,000 hours of watching, some content types are absent from Netflix. So, the fans of live sports, classic movies, and news have already found better alternatives. The same applies to people interested in free streaming.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Netflix originals cover all the possible flaws of this platform. Subscribe to enjoy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/netflix/id363590051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download from AppStore.</a></p>
<h3 id="youtube">#2 YouTube TV</h3>

<p>Everyone loves YouTube, and its YouTube TV experience is highly enjoyable. The service works cable-free, works on numerous devices, and has a huge library of broadcasts available.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams: </b>Up to 3 devices</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $12 per month</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Compatible with numerous devices</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">High subscription price</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube is another obvious choice for top TV apps. Containing all sorts of videos, YouTube TV service offers to download and watch them later offline.</p>
<p>The streaming on YouTube TV is free of advertisement after you pay for the subscription.</p>
<p>As a choice for Fire TV, YouTube TV enables browsing by interest area, connecting your device with several accounts, searching by voice, and playing 4K video.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-tv/id1193350206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download from AppStore.</a></p>
<h3 id="amazon">#3 Amazon Prime Video</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19827 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2.png" alt="Amazon TV apps" width="1289" height="657" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2.png 1289w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-300x153.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-768x391.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-600x306.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-450x229.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/image2-1000x510.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1289px) 100vw, 1289px" /></p>
<p>Amazon Prime Video is also a leader in the TV streaming market. The application is a real competitor to Netflix and a second choice for most movie admirers.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> $12 per month / $119 per year</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<p>+ Supports all the top platforms</p>
<p>+ Offers unique content (Amazon originals)</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Paid subscription only</li>
</ul>
<p>According to TCL, Amazon Prime Video is the #3 choice for the U.S. citizens aged 35-54. Generally, the TV app is popular all over the world. In its library, you can find different types of content: movies, TV shows, documentaries, Amazon originals, and live TV streams.</p>
<p>It seems like a nice alternative to Netflix originals if you want to try something different.</p>

<p>MakeUseOf magazine lists Plex as a top remote app for TV streaming on Fire TV. We couldn’t omit this app from our overview as well.</p>
<p>Plex is a great choice for streaming movies from your library on different devices around your house. If you decide to go for Plex Pass, you won’t need an Internet connection to play those videos.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Plex is that you can download it from Amazon Appstore. As an Android TV app, the installation process requires a Plex server. It should be on another laptop that connects to your Android device through Wi-Fi. After that, Plex will play your files instantly, without using wires for transferring files.</p>
<p>Finally, this TV app works as a media center application that is really enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>By the way, to make your Fire TV works correctly, make sure</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your ADB Debugging is enabled (Select “My Fire TV” is Settings and put ADB Debugging “On” in the Developer Options menu)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Stick allows the installation of unknowing services (Choose “Device” and “Developer Options” in Settings, you’ll see “Apps from Unknown Services” in the menu)</li>

The type of content Kodi works with includes movies, documentaries, music, live TV clips, etc.</p>
<p>To work on Fire TV, it requires sideloading onto another device. That’s why it’s not recommended for people who don’t like working with settings. To install, read a couple of articles in Google on the matter — there’s nothing difficult about learning how to do it, learning how to do it just requires extra time.</p>
<p>Kodi is not compatible with iOS, but you can download several options for remote control from AppStore.</p>

<p>Pandora is a free radio streaming service compatible with numerous devices. In addition to songs, there are some comedy channels for entertainment.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b> TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen,LG Smart TV</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Limitless</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> Free</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Free service</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The library has only comedies</li>
</ul>
<p>This year, Pandora has become one of the top 3 picks for the U.S. millennials. And there’s no surprise — the app outperforms Spotify for being free. The functionality of the app allows playing favorite shows on TV, in web browsers, or on the screen of your car.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the video library of the app has only comedy channels. That’s why it deserved a place at the bottom of our list only, no matter how user-friendly the experience offered is. But you can try its comedies — maybe, you’ll like them.</p>

<p>The platform is a digital storefront of movies and TV shows. Users are offered to either purchase a digital license or rent a chosen file for several days. There is no subscription option.</p>
<p><b>Compatible devices:</b>  TCL Roku, Samsung Smart Hub, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, LG Smart TV, Vizio Cast TVs</p>
<p><b>Simultaneous streams:</b> Limitless</p>
<p><b>Subscription price:</b> In-app purchases in à la carte menu of movies</p>
<p><b>Pros and cons list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Supports all top TV platforms</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A very limited choice and number of functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Play Movies &amp; TV resembles an old-fashioned shop where you could rent some movies and bring them back. Though sounding rather romantic, this approach is a bit outdated in the contemporary world. It’s much easier (and cheaper) to buy for the service, not for each movie separately.</p>
<p>But the experience is worth a try.</p>
<p>The very idea of Google Play Movies &amp; TV appeared in the competition with iTunes from Apple. In the latest version, the developers added such a heavy compatibility package that the app turned into a complete TV streaming service. However, the software requires lots of other features to become a top pick in the niche.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this rapidly changing global business and humanity environment — where cost is a true strategic differentiator — Devmind findings provide an inside look at the practices and trends currently shaping the future of enterprises.</p>
<p><b>In brief:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</li>
<li>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results,&#8221; — Gartner.</li>
<li>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses, including collaborative models, dedicated teams, and remote work.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1. A challenging landscape</h1>
<p>As a typical “black swan” event, COVID-19 took the world by complete surprise. This newly identified coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, on December 31, 2019. As we almost enter April 2020, the virus has infected over 700,000 people, led to more than 30,000 deaths, and has spread to more than 200 countries.</p>
<p>The focus of most businesses is now on protecting employees, understanding the risks to their business, and managing the supply chain disruptions caused by the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of this epidemic on businesses is still unknown. However, one thing is certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Optimizing costs is a perennial, continuous cross-enterprise effort organizations take into consideration now more than ever. <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/driving-cost-optimization-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost optimization</a> is a critical imperative for any functional leader, but its execution and impact reach far beyond the limits of any single functional area.</p>
<p><b>Cost optimization should not be confused with budget reductions. </b>When undertaking budget reductions, functional leaders — be they marketing leads, supply chain managers, business unit directors or technology team leaders — are often asked only to hit budget reduction targets within their own departments. While a more holistic, enterprise wide approach may be beneficial, the ability of functional leaders to impact areas outside their control is often limited.</p>
<p>Organizations should approach cost optimization as an expansive effort that can have both immediate and long-term significance for business performance. To truly serve the enterprise, cost optimization demands a mix of improvements that touch every part of the enterprise.</p>
<h1>2. Under-digitized businesses are hard-hit</h1>
<p>Businesses that are currently struggling for profitability — those with low or unstable cash reserves — are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-germany/featured-topics/cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Predicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even businesses that appear to be in good financial shape may not be immune, depending on how the situation progresses. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment and air transportation have been particularly hard-hit in the short term.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19345 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg" alt="industries that suffer the most" width="1235" height="596" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-600x290.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-450x217.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1000x483.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Businesses in consumer goods and retail may also be at higher- than-normal financial risk, especially those in seasonal businesses where demand may be lost (as opposed to shifted), such as such perishable consumer goods and seasonal apparel. Even commodity-oriented industries, such as metals and mining or oil and gas, are exposed as global demand shifts and pricing fluctuates.</p>
<h1>3. Building blocks for change: cost optimization initiatives</h1>
<p>Given the importance of managing cash flows in times like this, companies should immediately develop a <b>plan for cost optimization as part of their overall business risk and </b><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/business-continuity-efforts-in-response-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>continuity plans</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>In doing so, it is essential to take a full ecosystem perspective, as the approaches you take to manage cash will have implications for not only your business but also for your customers.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19351 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg" alt="IT cost optimization pic" width="1235" height="887" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-768x552.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-600x431.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-450x323.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1000x718.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Borrowing from the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the 2008 recession and credit crunch, and the last black swan event to significantly impact global economy — the Japanese earthquake of 2011 — we see the following practices and strategies as worth considering today.</p>
<p>Among them: ensuring your own financing remains viable, focusing on the cash-to-cash conversion cycle, thinking like a CFO, revisiting your variable costs and capital investment plans, extending payables, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Shared services, business process outsourcing, </b><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/dci9/documents/gartner-infrastructure-operations-cloud-india-cost-optimization-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>automation of IT operations</b></a> — all these components offer considerable cost saving opportunities. Enterprise cost optimization priorities — to preserve revenue, continue to innovate and keep the best staff — often conflict with the cost reduction priorities of functional leaders, which are to reduce costs quickly with as little disruption as possible.</p>
<h1>4. Five areas of focus for the enterprise</h1>
<p>While there is a great amount of functional variability in how leaders approach cost optimization, five areas of focus allow leaders in various roles and business units to pursue beneficial optimization (see the figure mentioned below).</p>
<h2>1) Benchmark to get a baseline</h2>
<p>The use of comparative metrics is a key aspect of any effective cost optimization campaign. <b>Benchmarks help leaders analyze their environments to discover what resources and initiatives may require additional funding or optimization.</b></p>
<p>Benchmarks also showcase areas of strategic investment. But care is required, as benchmarks can easily be misused.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19347 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg" alt="cost optimization across enterprise" width="1235" height="957" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-600x465.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-450x349.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1000x775.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<h2>2) Identify critical points in the budget to shield</h2>
<p>To bring more clarity to the optimization decision-making process, companies should identify:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">the potential financial benefit;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business impact;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business risk;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">time requirement of candidate cost optimization projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of impact, the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/services/gx-deloitte-global-cost-management-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost optimization initiative</a> is partly contingent on whether business unit leaders and their staff are capable of changing and adapting to new approaches and processes.</p>
<p>For example, optimization may involve frontline systems and tool automation as part of their business processes. What does this adaptation mean when leaders consider implementation and training timeframes?</p>
<p>To gain CEO or CFO approval for an initiative, leaders can describe a business case showing how the <b>cost optimization initiative will improve such criteria as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business processes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-to-market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The like, as opposed to continuing with the status quo.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria points offer a suitable framework for prioritizing which line items are worth preserving, and which projects are worth supporting.</p>
<h2>3) Identify noncritical points to eliminate</h2>
<p>Just as crucial to the decision-making process is the identification of aspects of the business that can be eliminated or reduced. These changes will be primarily quantifiable as reductions in expense, but, again, leaders should consider the significance of each point to the business. An enterprise&#8217;s position within the growth model — growing, mature or declining — serves as an initial driver for identifying and prioritizing cost optimization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growing companies have a higher tendency to <b>standardize and simplify IT- enabled capabilities in order to optimize costs</b> and meet business goals for matching service levels to customer demand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mature enterprises typically respond to cost optimization goals with investment-based programs. </b>These programs aim to automate or utilize capabilities at lower capacity costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Determine cost optimization approach</h2>
<p>Several options exist for optimization, including reduction of costs, reduction of demand, and a balance of short- and long-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Some categories of optimization functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Instituting emergency cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Applying selective cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving costs and business value.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing costs for added business value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5) Communicate plans to stakeholders and lead the organization through the change</h2>
<p>The leader of a cost optimization program will be in constant contact with all business areas. Communication of best practices should always include details of the practice and expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Leaders can also offer a list of alternative options that were considered, along with detailed explanations outlining why the alternative options were not selected.</p>
<h1>5. Accelerating through cost-efficient remote work</h1>
<p>A virtual remote workforce enables organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive growth and better serve customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increase business productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Attract top talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only remote work enables organizations to shift labor costs to lower cost resources, cut travel and expense budgets, and reduce fixed facility costs, but also a virtual workforce gives organizations a greater degree of flexibility to take advantage of lower cost labor regardless of location — and engage workers only when and where the business needs. For example, many workers sourced from outlying areas and offshore locations, such as Lusaka have significantly lower wages than similarly qualified resources.</p>
<p>From Google to Ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to work from home in a bid to stem the spread of pandemic. Such remote working at scale is unprecedented and will leave a lasting impression on the way people live and work for many years to come. What companies need in uncertain times is a collaborative mindset and the ability to map and analyze the value created deep within employee networks.</p>
<h1>6. Collaborative models and dedicated teams value</h1>
<p>Although collaboration is one of the most crucial components of modern businesses, most companies still do not know how to get the most out of it. Here are some of the <b>collaborative models tactics we apply here, at Devmind:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The team members from different time zones are not assigned for one micro task.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are organized between each other to ensure “rolling style” execution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All developers work shifted hours to ensure the best possible communications.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work time designed so that all teams have 2 hours of overlap with regular PST work time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Overlaps are used for daily scrums, any meetings and informal collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19346" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg" alt="distributed teams" width="1235" height="833" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1000x674.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>What companies need in a collaborative age is the ability to map and analyze the value created within employee networks. These networks should focus on both — individual and organizational effectiveness and on the value the interactions between employees and companies are created.</p>
<p>To make these interactions more useful, executives must reorient them toward the revenue and productivity benefits that collaborative models generate, the costs such interactions impose, and opportunities to improve connectivity at the points that create the greatest economic value.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Teams As More Cost-Effective Approach for Under-Digitized Businesses</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/dedicated-development-team-reimagined-and-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated team model</a> aims to provide a client with the right developers regardless of wherever the developers and the client are, and negotiate a mode of cooperation: nearshore (in close proximity to the client), onshore (on the client’s premises), or offshore (remotely).</p>
<p>Moreover, dedicated teams are known for their flexibility, niche skills, high scaling velocity, and high loyalty. As dedicated teams offer immense flexibility, the client has a lot of space to be efficient with their budget. The key industries that look for dedicated team approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthcare</a> (among them a lot of pharmaceutical companies);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/hospitality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel &amp; hospitality</a>;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/ar-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19352 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="1033" height="462" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png 1033w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-300x134.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1024x458.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-768x343.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-600x268.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-450x201.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1000x447.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /></p>
<h1>7. Beyond pandemic: risks and security</h1>
<p>For some organizations, survival is the only way of implementing things today. Others are crawling through the fog of uncertainty, guessing what’s next, where should be the next turn, when things get back to normal. The question is, what will new normal look like?</p>
<p>No one can answer this question for sure now. But what we believe we can state is that the new normal is already here. The pandemic has made it harder for companies to maintain risks and so — the security and stability of their operations and even survival mode. But new tactics can help leaders to safeguard their people and organizations.</p>
<p>We, at Devmind, empower companies and their workforces with digital transformation services and approaches to help them survive during these times. Are you and your organization looking for it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">We are executing against one the hardest times of our lives. Businesses are rapidly assessing fast-changing developments and the implications for their organizations. With crises like COVID-19, the time to act is now. The creation of elastic workplaces, efficient BCPs, and distributed workforces might be an answer to uncertain times and can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19199" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-scaled.jpg" alt="distributed teams during pandemic" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>Main points:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">How to act now: an elastic digital workplace and business flexibility.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed agile teams: a new way to deliver at scale.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking one step ahead.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.  Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism</h2>
<p>Businesses worldwide have been reacting to the recent humanitarian and societal crisis that is forever going down in history as COVID-19. Today, we already witness an incredible power of the pandemic: disrupted workforces, supply chains, worldwide economic activity, and more to come in months. But what is it really: chaos or new opportunities for organizations to become more flexible and improve their business continuity management plans?</p>
<p>The reality is that every crisis or disaster sooner or later has both immediate and long-term implications of how businesses operate and impact society. So, it is with a sense of urgency that organizations should refer to their decades-long <b>IT business continuity plans</b><b> to ensure their operational and strategic resilience and agility.</b></p>
<p>Leaders (and not only them) are making rapid, highly-informed decisions. They should take immediate action to protect and support their workforce and ensure that all business operations continue in order to help business and societal continuities. Here are some of the most crucial components of how to behave today to safeguard the antifragility of your organization.</p>
<h2>2. IT Business <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity plan&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Continuity Plan</span>: Elastic Workplace and Business Flexibility</h2>
<p>The transition to remote work during coronavirus and distributed teams is accelerating daily. Tools are getting better. More companies embrace the benefits of their employees not being bound to a specific remote workplace on the scale of cities, countries, and even continents. Current disruptions to the workforce (as a result of remote working) requires workplace elasticity and business processes flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19200" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-scaled.jpg" alt="remote work from home" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity and disaster recovery&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">IT business continuity and disaster recovery</span></h3>
<p>To minimize business disruption and protect employees from consequences of threats, organizations should have not only a profound pandemic plan for business continuity but also be able to emerge from one of the most surreal moments of the recent memory.</p>
<p>Here are the <b>three most essential foundations leaders should pay attention to</b> today:</p>
<p>1. Empowering workforce and building a digital workplace</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A</b><b>nalyze your current technology capabilities</b>, including a communications plan and support structure. It’s essential to keep leadership and employees aware of current fundamental changes;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Examine your ability to scale out internally.</b> Make sure that digital workplaces enable your people to work remotely through digital collaboration tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start cultivating a digital culture and shifting to the mindset of collaboration.</b> Undoubtedly, your employees will require additional skills around the new way of working. Building the necessary skill set and remote workplace of trust can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Serving your customers’ core needs</p>
<p>Businesses adapt to serve customers through uncertainty. This, of course, means organizations are increasingly thinking out of the box to find creative ways to continue working with clients smoothly.</p>
<p>Highly extendable workplace environments allow organizations <b>to adapt to changing business needs based on global conditions.</b> Moreover, being extremely transparent in communication, operations, and engagements — is key to a successful transition from unpredictability to trusted relationships.</p>
<p>3. Establishing business continuity planning steps</p>
<p>While no systems can perfectly anticipate every contingency, ensuring that all business units are supported, informed, and protected as much as possible, can greatly untie your hands to develop new business processes. This means continuing to work while adapting to the new IT business continuity plan, ways of collaborating, and decision-making. But what is more important — to conduct additional disaster testing scenarios in parallel with operational work.</p>
<h3>Six steps for businesses’ quick reaction</h3>
<p>Today enterprises recognize the need to respond effectively to disruptions caused by factors outside their control. By following these steps for quick workplace adaptation and reaction to risks, companies can highly minimize the disruptions and inefficiencies in their operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Workplace adaptation to disruptions in 2020</b></p>

<h2>3. Distributed Agile Teams: a New Way to Deliver at Scale</h2>
<p>At Devmind, we have worked with distributed teams for many years now. Lowering costs while increasing the pace of business — is no easy task. But it seems to be quite effective and allows for even greater potential benefits if implemented correctly.</p>
<p>Distributed agile teams require more communication and touchpoints. On the other hand, they can bring productivity and speed traditional teams simply cannot. Moreover, communication tools, project management approaches, and planning processes are improving all the time, leaving more space for collaboration and consistency.</p>
<p>Despite being thousands of kilometers apart, every employee interacts with the same board, is able to track the overall progress, and share lessons learned. During turbulent times like today’s one, it is just one of a few reliable ways your company can continually improve the work in a long-term perspective and improve business continuity strategy for the years to come.</p>

<h2>4. Thinking One Step Ahead</h2>
<p>The threats like COVID-19 will fundamentally change the way we work and engage. Leaders should develop a comprehensive BCP and new scenarios for its implementations, paying great attention to those basic steps we describe in this article.</p>
<p>The most important thing to recognize about coronavirus business impact is that operations cannot be considered to be business as usual (BAU) but must become business as survival (BAS).</p>
<p>To achieve the necessary resilience, leadership and С-level should clearly identify what businesses and operational processes in the organization are crucial to operating the core functions, and what — are not.</p>
<p>As the situation keeps developing, we will update our materials, so please check back regularly.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technologies constantly develop and enhance, thus influencing other fields of human activity, including business, marketing, healthcare, education, etc. More and more enterprises start working on strategies and ways to begin enterprise digital transformation. Some of the enterprises have already started the implementation of digital technologies in order to keep on the top positions in the field.</p>
<p>The latest business, technological, and marketing trends make it inevitable for enterprises to initiate a digital transformation process. Digital transformation of the enterprise means the implementation of digital solutions into the systems of the company. There is a number of technologies that are already used and change the image of the business world. Among these technologies, there is IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), Cloud Computing, Blockchain. All of them enhance the workflow of the company, its organization, communication, as well as service delivery to the customers.</p>
<p>The digital transformation enterprise process cannot be done overnight. It is time- and resource-consuming, but the results worth it. The implementation of the technologies can bring a lot of advantages for the company, its employees, and customers. Let’s view them in detail.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Digital Transformation: The Advantages</h2>
<p>Reorganization of the processes internally and externally due to the digital enterprise transformation will have certain benefits for the companies that come along with the changes. We are going to highlight the top 5 advantages of the digital transformation for enterprises.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enterprise EfficiencyThe automation of the processes because of digital transformation will lead to the greater overall efficiency of the enterprise. The technologies like AI and ML can process data quickly, provide better insights, thus giving a possibility for the company to deliver more efficient services to the customers.</li>
<li>Better ProductivityThe implementation of smart technological solutions that sustain the digital transformation of the enterprises leads to better productivity. The solutions will help you automate certain processes within the company by minimizing the manual work, cut costs, facilitate the work of the employees, and enhance service delivery. For instance, less manual work will result in fewer mistakes, which leads to better services from the company.</li>
<li>Employee EmpowermentWhen the company starts its digital transformation process, it is important to keep everyone in the loop and spend time on training of the employees. It is necessary for everyone to know about the changes within the system and be able to conduct the work in the proper way. Improvement of the set of skills of your employees will motivate them to work better, give them a chance to show their creativity and share their innovative ideas. By educating the staff, the company, first of all, adds value to its services, thus offers better facilities and increases client satisfaction.</li>
<li>Enhanced Customer ExperienceThe above-listed advantages result in better customer satisfaction and high-quality experience. The better services you provide, the bigger the number of clients will return to use your services on a regular basis. Transparent transactions and quick delivery of the services is what clients expect from the enterprises. The proper usage of technological solutions for your benefit will help you attract more clients to the services you offer.</li>
<li>Increased RevenueAs a result, digital transformation will help you increase revenue. It’s possible thanks to the reduction of the costs spent on the maintenance of the business, automation of the processes, and better customer experience. The more hearts you win with your services, the more people will choose you over other companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>These benefits are the top ones, but its number is bigger, and we also can highlight higher security regarding both the company and its clients. Among them are better resource management; digital culture encouragement; possibility to create digital products/services; more efficient data analysis, etc.</p>
<p>Enterprises that thrive to get all these benefits from the digital transformation should create a detailed enterprise digital transformation strategy.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Digital Strategy for Your Business</h2>
<p>A strategy is an essential part of every process. If there is no solid strategy approved by all the parties involved or it is not shared with all the departments of the enterprise, consider you already failed in digital enterprise transformation.</p>
<p>A strategy is a detailed plan on the process of achievement of the long-term goals. It is a document that will highlight all the steps of the process, their possible outcomes, and expected results. Also, it is important that enterprise digital strategy is developed by the board of the enterprise leaders and includes all the departments.</p>
<p>A successful strategy consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea: no idea, no changes. If you want to keep the enterprise a leader in the field, survive the competition or maintain a successful reputation, you should come up with the idea that promotes digital transformation processes. Analyze the current state of affairs, the market, your position in it, think of the ways to enhance your business.</li>
<li>Total involvement: once you have a clear and defined idea, it’s time to share it with the board and make every department involved in the process. Listen to their ideas, take them into consideration, and together work out the most suitable scheme for digital transformation for the enterprise. As a result, everyone should know their role in the process, responsibilities, and work in coherence to achieve desired results.</li>
<li>Technology: choose the relevant technology that will take you on the journey to digital transformation. If there are some doubts or challenges with this part, you can consult with the third party and find ways to enhance the efficiency of the enterprise.</li>
<li>Tests: make sure that your team is aware of the possible risks and is ready to run pilot tests. Every step and its result should be documented in order to minimize risks and move successfully to your goals.</li>
<li>Change: if you are on the digital transformation path, an enterprise should be ready to change every day. The transformation requires constant analysis of the processes and data received in order to enhance services and find new opportunities for the business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Digital Enterprise Transformation Roadmap?</h2>
<p>Once the enterprise has an enterprise digital transformation strategy, it’s time to build a roadmap to achieve the expected goals. It is a unique plan that will coordinate the enterprise on its way to digital transformation. Each stage of the transformation process should have a clear roadmap that consists of smaller steps. In its turn, every roadmap consists of the three main stages.</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Defining Value</h3>
<p>The enterprise should analyze its position on the market, involve every department in the process of digitalization and define small, and big goals it wants to achieve. It follows that every goal that leads to the overall enterprise transformation should be divided into smaller steps that add value to the ongoing process.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Launching and Maintaining</h3>
<p>Once all the resources are collected and accordingly allocated, the enterprise can launch the first project. Then test it, collect data, compare the expected results and the real ones, and maintain new innovations or add changes if required. At the same time, the team involved in the process should constantly upgrade its skills and enhance their knowledge in order to lead the enterprise to the transformation successfully.</p>
<h3>Stage 3: Scaling Up</h3>
<p>When the first projects are launched, and you start to see positive outcomes, it’s time to scale up the process and move further. Upgrade the technologies used, add new features or services, as well as enhance the skills of everyone working for the enterprise. The digital transformation itself means constant change and improvement, so everyone involved in the process should be ready to adapt quickly and effectively in order to reach higher goals.</p>
<p>Overall, the digital transformation enterprise can view as a difficult way that requires a lot of changes and resources, but as we can see, it has a number of benefits. These changes will enhance the work of the employees, deliver better services to the customers, and as a result, bring more revenue for the company. Enterprise leaders should wisely plan a strategy for the organization, describe every step that should be taken, think of the possible outcomes in order to succeed with the transformation process. The path is rather long and requires a lot of time effort, but it is a way to future prosperity and a chance to survive the ongoing competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><i>In the era of connected enterprises and total digitalization, finding a balance between optimizing productivity and innovating has never been simpler, yet more difficult, than ever before. </i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial intelligence</a>, machine learning, the <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet of Things</a>, automation, and <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other technologies</a> bring us more and more new types of data. On the one hand, it’s good to have a space for maneuvers. However, on the other hand, many senior executives remain less prepared than they think they are. Navigating the <strong>Fourth Industrial Revolution not only changes the way we think but also impacts how we learn and work using data</strong> to create value from the findings obtained through advanced technologies.</p>
<h2>An amalgam of opportunity and ambiguity</h2>
<p>According to a recent Deloitte Global <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a>, 72% of C-level executives across 19 countries (from the Americas, Asia, and Lusaka, and came from all major industry sectors) are <strong>ready to adopt and effectively use smart and autonomous technologies</strong> within their organizations.</p>
<p>43% of them consider a lack of internal alignment about which strategies to follow, as the most significant challenge their organizations face as they seek to adopt new technologies and applications. Devmind’s experts have created unique infographics to shed some light on the most vital aspects and challenges the concept of Industry 4.0 owns today.</p>

<h2>What’s next? A New Lens of Innovation or Another Revolution</h2>
<p>When it comes to an impact Industry 4.0 will have on organizations and, most importantly, on the workforce, many questions arise. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22% of executives</a> surveyed believe that the new industrial revolution will have a significant effect on their companies. Another question — what kind of effect it will be.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Industry 4.0 is bringing changes to every geography and solution. Yet many executives still do not express the urgency of tackling the challenge of using the full potential of smart technologies to enable digital-physical integration. It is evident that the old way of doing things isn’t enough anymore, but many executives continue to focus on traditional business operations.</p>
